<p class="MsoNormal"></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><u><span style="font-family:Arial">Czech Mates:</span></u></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">Yup, Ali Gee, Richee,
Keithee, Stubbee, Grandpop Bill,</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">Royzee, Timmee, Sean, Neil
Bonker Banks, Jay Cee, D Ceen his glasses, </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">M Ceen (in place of Tatee),
Grazie.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">D Ceen his glasses
volunteered to organise the hotel bookings, flights and connections for this
trip and began in earnest by overlooking the Stokey Wokey group when arranging
the hotel booking.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Perhaps he was
under the influence ?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">Ah
well, it all got sorted in the end</span> and the trip was booked for all 14 of
us&nbsp; for 3<sup>rd</sup> October 2004.</span></p>
<h1>Sunday</h1>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">On arrival at East Midlands
airport we followed the new procedure of labelling our own luggage.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>After a little confusion, especially for Ali Gee (as it later became
apparent), all were labelled and checked in before we proceeded to the bar area
ready for boarding.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">&nbsp;Royzee was keen to
get out of the country and avoid the rumpus that was about to take place when
the management turn up for work to find a totally reorganised car parking layout
that he�d had a little hand in.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">&nbsp;On board, Ali Gee had
to be convinced that the aeroplane had been built by Rover, not Fiat, before he
reluctantly let go of two bright yellow life jackets that he�d nicked for each
arm.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The flight was short, but long
enough for him to devour about fifty blueberry muffins, as they�d run out of
his favourite galaxy muffins.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Stubbee
was lucky enough to find some chewing gum on his armrest, which had locked onto
his sleeve.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It kept him going until
he could open his loaded goody bag which he�d struggled to get on board, full
of turkey baps, chocolate bars and drinks.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial"><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp;</span>All went well when we arrived until after waiting at the
luggage collection point for around 2 hours, it finally dawned on us that Ali
Gees rucksack hadn�t turned up.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A
clunk we heard earlier on the plane must have been his bag falling off together
with his clean underpants.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The only
possessions he�d got with him were his wallet, shades, and a book entitled<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>�a great weekend in Prague�.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">Booking in the Pyramidia
hotel was fun to watch, starting with Jaycee�s annoyance with the receptionist
for referring to him as Gohn rather than John.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>And for some strange reason, D Ceen his glasses� insisted his booking
be made separately, to get his air miles.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
receptionist was reluctant at first, resulting in D Ceen his glasses getting
shirty, which is unusual now he�s been on a course for self control; but
eventually the hiccup was resolved.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family:Arial">After
Ali had finished unpacking his book and shades, we ventured down to the hotel
bar, as everywhere in the immediate vicinity had closed for the night.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>No draft ale was available, but the bottled lagers, beginning
with the light and gradually moving on to the darker ones, were very palatable,
until the shutters were manually erected and the bar shut down. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">When JayCee was unable to
order a sandwich, we decided, to my relief, to book the restaurant for the 14 of
us, which was open till the early hours.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Having
smuggled a gift of a sainsbury�s pork pie and a jar of colman�s mustard over
from old blighty, I�d locked them in the room safe, but was beginning to have
doubts as to whether or not it'd be strong enough to keep Ali out, if he got
peckish in the night.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<h1>Monday</h1>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">After a good nights sleep
(for the residents of neck-end), and a reasonable continental breckie, we met up
eager and ready for action.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It was
revealed that Stubbie had been up at 7am to do a few lengths in the pool before
breakfast but it didn�t open till 9am, and that JayCee had fallen out again
with the receptionist over an extra pillow.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Royzie jumped the gun and bought a tram ticket to the city centre but as
we were walking into town he needn�t have bothered.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">The walk to the monastery
was only 5 minutes, passing a shop where the beer was 60 and the water was 70
Kronas.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A difficult choice, but a
lesson learnt from Munich swayed the final decision.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">Onward and downward we took
in the sights down to the palace. The views were magnificent and the hot sun was
shining from a completely blue sky.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We
waited a short while to check out the changing of the guards outside the palace.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Stubbee stuck his leg out as he filmed the guards and suggested renaming
the procedure to the �tripping of the colour�.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">The Cathedral was next on
the agenda.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There were thousands
milling around, so you�d be wise to safeguard your wallet in an area like
this,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>well most people would.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>However, as we completed the tour and sauntered out into the light, D
Ceen his glasses exclaimed �me wallets gone?�.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">The stark realisation that
he wasn�t joking slowly dawned on us.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Impossible
we all thought.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>How on earth could
anyone have found his wallet when he can never find it himself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Now he�ll never get a round in.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">Luckily, son M Ceen was
available to sub him a couple of Kronas, so we moved on in search of cheap beer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>It just so happened that Yup knew a well renowned traditional Czech pub
in the back streets near the British Embassy; which provided us with some
interesting pork type meals and buckets of ale for under �4 each.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">Next stop, after a few
piccys of Winston and choruses of �Where�s me wallet gone?�, was the
river, to meet Carl, Captain of one of the pleasure boats, and present him with
the Sainsbury�s pork pie and jar of Colman�s mustard, which I�d promised
to bring him on a previous trip.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Sadly,
he was off duty today, so they were quickly handed over to his wife before Ali
Gee got the scent, with the promise that we�d be back for a trip up the river
tomorrow.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">On the bridge Royzee rubbed
the brass sculpture for luck.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He�d
need it for when he gets back to the office.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">Over the bridge and
finally, Ali Gee, still without a clean pair of pants or a shirt, spotted a gift
shop selling extra fat b�d size tee shirts.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Shame they didn�t sell pants in his size.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">Time for a drink near the
astronomical clock.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The prices were
too high outside in the square, so we found an indoor bar with a wild clock
inside a cage!!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>At 5pm several made
a quick dash outside to see the clock strike on the hour, and Royzie knocked the
milk over on the table.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The waiters
rudely began requesting tips but didn�t get one, except off<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>�D Ceen his wallet�, who suggested that they try filling
the glasses next time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">A quick tram ride back to
the hotel and it was off to a nearby shop to buy a toothbrush and razor for Ali,
who by this time was minging.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Still
no pants for sale though.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Grazie
came jogging past, training for the prague marathon, and managed an �evening
gentlemen�, before collapsing in the hotel lobby.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">Still no sign of Ali
Gee�s rucksack, despite phone calls to East Midlands airport, so still no
clean pants.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Grumbling, �I
don�t know if I�m going out tonight cus I�ve got to do some laundry� the
taunts from Yup finally enticed him out, even though he was minging worse than
ever.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">We caught the tram outside
the hotel and went in search of a restaurant.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>After a quick peruse, a Mexican, highly recommended to Yup, was chosen
and an abundance of fajitas, chicken wings, potato skins, nachos, chips and god
knows what ever else, was ordered.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Bonka
took the plunge and ordered a vegetarian chicken meal.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">Plenty of wine and velvet
beer (a creamflow type lager, ugh) were served up during the meal followed by
cocktails, shorts and other weird concoctions to complete the session.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Stubbee was first to win an Oscar for his impersonation of the mask after
supping a sambuca coffee through a straw, in one go.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">This was Bill�s first
ever Mexican meal and he loved it, especially the bit where he attempted to set
fire to the coffee beans in his attempt to crack the atom.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">Only �13 each and enough
corks to drown out some of Ali Gees snoring through the forthcoming night, or so
I thought.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">Bill reminisced over the
Mexican on the way back to the hotel, whilst declaring his love for Prague.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The night was clear and the stars were shining, but Stubbee outshone the
lot with his wind instrument repertoire, closely followed by Keithee with a
fanfare rendition, before entering the hotel bar for a quick�un.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">The tale endings of an
earlier exhibition occupied the bar area but we made ourselves at home
nevertheless, especially the Del boys; Stubbie and Richee, who sat and slurped
their ways through margarita cocktails, a right pair of penis coladas.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">At 12.55.am came a knock on
the bedroom door.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Expecting to get
told off for laughing and excess merriment, we were stunned when Ali�s
rucksack was handed over by the hotel porter.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Finally clean pants, if only we could get into the damned thing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>It had been sealed so well, that, try as we did, we couldn�t open it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>We even tried using the television remote to cut the tape, but only
succeeded in putting Sky news on.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">Finally, the clean pants
were out.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Overwhelmed and over
nourished, Ali�s little head hit the pillow, and within a minute he was fast
asleep and ����.snoring, triggering the seed of a tsunami on the other
side of the world.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">I became very attached to
the view from the bedroom window, where I stood and tried to shelter my ears
from the thunderous snorts from the opposite side of the bedroom.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I can remember every inch of every cobble between the tram tracks, as I
stared out of that window, waiting for the sun to rise and Ali to wake from his
slumber.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The local direct works
lads began digging up the road but even the noise of the jackhammers wasn�t
enough to drown out his snoring.</span></p>
&nbsp;
<h1>Tuesday</h1>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">After breakfast we split
into 2 groups, with an agreement to meet up in an hour or so in Wenceslas
Square.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Shaun and Bonker went awol
and were to turn up later at the river. Those in search of Stata Prague, the
local football stadium, went one way, and the rest slipped into the monastery
brewery to czeck out the amber and dark beers; in the interest of helping out
the monks of course in their research, and for Bill.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>In the city centre, as we sat waiting in the sunshine admiring the local
shops, the call came through from �D Ceen his wallet� that he�d now lost
his bearings, as well as his wallet.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Luckily,
we had the shops to ogle over whilst we waited another half an hour.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">Rocky O�Reilleys was near
by so we popped in for lunch and a drop of black stuff.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Suitably refreshed we wandered off to the main station I
think, checking out train times for the trip to Karlstein castle, and the Jewish
quarter, before making our way to the river to see if Captain Carl was on duty,
and luckily he was.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>After a few
introductions and a wee bit of skilful negotiating, discounted trips of 50% were
obtained before sitting in a beer garden waiting to be called on board.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">Again the sun was beating
down and the sky was blue.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The boat
trip was very relaxing interrupted only by some weird commentary that was
difficult to follow, despite the translation.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">As we came to shore, Bonker
and Shaun were spotted amongst the statues on the bridge and a joyful reunion
ensued back into the beer garden, before returning back to the monastery for
another spot of research before returning to the hotel.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>One or two couldn�t stand the pace and returned direct to the hotel,
namely, Royzee, Shaun, Bonka, and Grazee.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>JayCee
and Timmee were the only county wounty wallers who could.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">That evening we wandered
around aimlessly for half an hour before going for an excellent meal at the
restaurant next to the beer garden where we�d sat earlier; baring some
resemblance to a beer cellar. Royzee, Timmee and Bonker went their separate ways
in search of a 3 course meal.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span></p>

record Ali�s snoring.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Unfortunately
it was so loud, the recording became distorted as the soldered joints on the
electronic board inside it were blown apart and the sounds of car alarms which
were set off within a mile radius echoed round the room.<span style="mso-spacerun:

a snippet at around 4.30 am when he started again.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Locals were out in their masses, likening the noise to that
of a �Vulcan�, a six-barrelled electric Gatling gun capable of firing more
than 6,000 rounds per minute, which they�d last heard during the german
occupation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Wednesday, ( final day )</h1>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">A trip to Karlstein castle
was on the cards for the last day and we set out on the tram from the hotel to
the main station.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Bonker had thrown
his ticket away after the first stage of the tram run, not realising he�d need
it to complete the journey.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Luckily,
good old Royzee ran backwards up the escalators to give him a helping hand, as
he was holding us all up, and rummaged through the bins to find it before we
could continue.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">Patience is a virtue, or so
they say.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Sadly, when we got to the
train station, Royzee had lost his, and eager to get his train ticket first, he
queued up at a separate kiosk to the rest of us.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Meanwhile, a huge group discount was successfully organised
by Yupmeister at another kiosk for the rest of the group.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">As it happened, the timing
and cost of the train, (for most of us), to Karlstein was spot on.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The carriages were a little bit dated but nevertheless practical, as �D
Ceen his wallet� found out when he went to the toilet and discovered it opened
out directly onto the tracks below.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Luckily
he spotted it before he opened his bowels.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Bonker, grateful to Royzee for his assistance in finding his ticket,
opened a bottle of fizzy water on the train in celebratory fashion and showered
Royzee across the table.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>�Plonker�,
or some other similar explicit could be heard.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">From the station at
Karlstein, the short walk to the castle took us through quaint narrow streets
adorned with gift shops and beer gardens.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
sounds of budgerigars could be heard from one of the gardens.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Budgerigars to everyone except Royzee who was convinced they were
parrots.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Jaycee knew the difference
of course, having previously endured the pleasure of a great big squawking
parrot stationed outside his bedroom door at the Swiss family Robinson�s b
&amp; b in Ireland, a couple or three years ago; or was it a cockatiel?</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">Bill took a fancy to a
Gerry hat on sale, but reality finally hit home when he realised he�d either
got to get it into his suitcase, or wear it on the plane.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">Royzee was being troubled
with bouts of wind but didn�t dare let rip in case of a follow through.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Memories of the �brown eyes� melody drifted back from yet another
previous trip to Ireland.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>To be on the safe side Royzee paid 5 kronas to use a public
toilet but there was to be no thunderous volcanic emission as expected, just a
meek whimper.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">We stopped for lunch and a
few beers in the sunshine just below the castle, except for Grazee
�lard-dee-da<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Darjeeling� who
had tea with a hint of Venetian vanilla, before making the climb eventually up
to the castle for one of their tours.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
tour took around an hour.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A
neck-end carriage had been preserved and was spotted in mint condition in one of
the rooms.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">On the way back we stopped
again in the same beer garden whilst one or two went shopping.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Royzee came back with the largest boxed glass he could get his hands on
hoping to squeeze it onto the parcel shelf on the plane.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The ST1 club was spotted near the station but there were no takers.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">The day had obviously taken
its toll on Stubbee who struggled to open a window on the train journey back.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Luckily �D Ceen his wallet� was on hand to help out.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The seductive sound of the conductresses voice drifted through the
carriage and Keithee declared his love of her.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>A copy of the timetable now sits on his desk at work as a constant
reminder of her voice.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">Back in the main station,
and not for the last time I�m sure, Bonker, and Sean in tow, delayed the trip
back to the hotel, having forgotten to buy their tram tickets. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">Bill suggested we do a bit
more research at the monastery brewery.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And
who were we to argue with research and progress.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Just time then for a last quick�un, before eating our last Czech meal
at an Italian restaurant near the hotel.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Richee
was convinced we were getting into bad habits spending so much time at the
monastery, and pondered whether to invest in the brewery shares when he got
home.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">The Italian was cheap and
cheerful.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>�D Ceen his wallet�s
glasses were passed around the county wounty�s table, as is the norm these
days, to assist those whose eyes are diminishing with age to read the menu.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>They finally ended up on JayCee�s head where they remained unnoticed
for most of the night.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>At least
they didn�t end up in a pizza box this time. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">�D Ceen his wallet�,
Royzee, Shaun and �M Ceen his dad�s wallet� ordered tee-bone steaks.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Obviously the waitress had a problem with the translation and served up
kebabs on skewers.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>She had the same trouble at the Stokey�s table serving up a
pizza with extra olives instead of chillies.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Sounds similar I suppose.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">Back at the hotel the bags
were collected and the bills settled in a production that the New Vic theatre
would have been proud of, with D Ceen my wallet tearing into the receptionist
yet again and demanding that his bookings be put on one invoice.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">At the airport check-in the
pressure continued to tell on D Ceen my wallet, who uttered �get yer passports
up here now� in a mildly compelling sort of tone, before we passed through
immigration control and into duty free, where, yet again, he had another minor
difference of opinion with the sales girl over the purchasing of cigarettes. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">In the departure lounge
Stubbee had a minor heart attack as he thought he�d left his camera at the
passport control desk, but was put at ease when it was revealed that it had been
noticed and picked up.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">Back home and the question
remained on everyone�s lips;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">�How did �D Ceen his
wallet� manage without his wallet?�</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
