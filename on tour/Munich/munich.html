</span>2<sup>nd</sup>-5<sup>th</sup> October 2003</span></b>&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<h2 style="margin-left:70.9pt;text-indent:-70.9pt">Munich-Meisters</h2>
<h2><span style="font-weight:normal">Yupmeister, Keith ‘Jackomeister’, Keith
‘I’m on for itmeister’ Phillips, Spikemeister, Richmeister, Scottmeister,
JCmeister, Seanmeister, Timmeister and Graham replaced at the last minute by D
‘Ceen my glassesmeister’, after a session of bartering.</span><b>&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</b></h2>
<h2>Arrangements</h2>
<p class="MsoNormal">Well what a doddle, not.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The trip to the OCTOBERFEST in Munich took some sorting out but worth
every agonising minute spent on the phone and the internet, organising and re-organising.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The planning began at least 6-9 months before the trip, first of all
checking out who would be interested.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Craigy
Baby was always going to be 50/50, and who could handle the short flight to
Munich airport (just give me wings Beardie), the Octoberfest ale (did I really
collapse? Yupmeister), and the fairy-tale castle walk (Lionel Blair - Richie)
etc. etc.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Despite asking for anyone who was interested to contact me
by a certain date there’s always going to be one, well several burra wollers
as it happens.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>24 hours after the
deadline, and after the flight and hotels are booked, the burra wollers finally
confirm they’re on for it, and the group gladly expands from 6 to 10.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The same flight was available for all 10 of us, but there were no more
rooms at the same hotel, still there was always a boggen housen at the same
price!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I got my first bit of advice on the beer tents from a young
seasoned traveller, Yvonne, who lives in Germany, a mate of Zoë’s who said
that all you have to do is to sink a bockvurst, walk into a tent, find a seat
and order dinks.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It’s easy
perhaps for a young, single, attractive wench, but for us?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>If only it was that easy!!&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The tents have to be pre-booked in the March of the year
you want to go.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Easy, ……. not.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>By the second day of March all tents are generally booked, as are the
hotels.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>You’ve got to act fast.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>A list of tents is provided on the Munich tourist information site <span style="font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Verdana;color:black"><a href="http://www.muenchen-tourist.de" target="_top"><span style="font-size:
12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Comic Sans MS&quot;">www.muenchen-tourist.de</span></a></span>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Which one?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There are tents
for those with homosexual tendencies, ooaarrhh, and tents specialising in
particular types of food, music and for local rival football supporters, which I
was reliably informed, are best avoided if you want to live to see another day.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>You need to approach the tent organisers directly, whichever you finally
decide upon. Most weren’t available on the net, so letters would have to be
sent.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The biggest tent, the
Hofbraeu-Festzelt, appealed to me, and this one could be contacted quickly by
email.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Despite several attempts
though, most replies came back saying <i><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">‘Dear
Sir and Madam, thank you for your reservation/intrrest. Sorry bat wie are boockt
on this day.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>best regards<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>HB-Festzelt.’</span><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span></span><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">A reply eventually came through in the post from the beer
tent confirming that we had finally got a reservation…………..in German, of
course.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Well, we needed a
translator, and who better than Bickie (I’d be with you if me bladder would
hold up), fluent in thousands of languages since birth; well you had to be
living in Cross Heath.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It appeared
that we had somehow got a reservation on a balcony complete with food vouchers,
which had to be redeemed on the day, or otherwise lost.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>A half of chicken and a couple of steins including entry at around £15,
which was to be paid for up front, by bankers draft, oh pooh, another hurdle.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Translation between the camps made up for the language
barriers with the germans. A typical reply from the burra wollers was<i><span style="mso-spacerun: yes; font-family: Times New Roman">&nbsp;
</span></i>Guten Tag, Nein Sprechenzee Deutsch, Parlez vous Francais? Can you
ride a tandem? Ja mine Hoffmienster, Freitag Um wieviel Uhr? Auf wiedersehen
Johann.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>What hope did I have?&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The flights were booked through BMI baby at a ridiculous
low cost and all was fine and dandy until July when <i>‘there is a schedule
change to your flight with bmibaby. The new flight details are shown below. We
apologise for any inconvenience this may cause, but most changes result from
operational issues and are unavoidable’<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></i>They’d only gone and changed the flight dates by several days.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>After several desperate calls, the flights were rearranged to a day later
than planned.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Not too bad!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>This had repercussions, however, on the proposed itinery.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>A frantic call to JCmeister and eventually all was sorted.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>We would now spend the first full day at the beer tent and the second day
on the walk; vice versa to the original proposals.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Not to worry, at least the pre-arranged beer tent booking had not been
totally jeopardised.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Hotels in the city centre are fully booked several months
in advance, due to the popularity of the Fest.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The hotel Ibis was the only one I could book which I did easily by phone.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>They were very accommodating.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>No
problem once the number and dialling codes were worked out as they spoke ‘rate
fluent’ English, better than us Stokies.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>No more rooms available though for the burra wollers but JCmeister
managed to book a boggenhousen a couple of tube stops away.&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">So, the flights, hotel and beer tent were booked.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>We’d just got to sort the trains out when we arrived at the airport to
and from the hotel, and also the train to Fussen for a walk to Neuschwanstein,
the fairy tale castle nestled in the mountains.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Making advanced enquiries I was told that tickets were £40 for 10 of us
which I felt was too expensive.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As
it happened this was £4 each, a cracking price for a 1½ hour journey each way.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>They may not have won the war but the trains are excellent value.<b>&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Finally, Thursday 2<sup>nd</sup> October had arrived.</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Lederhosens packed and we were off.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>It was throwing it down; raining datsun cogs in fact as described by
Scottmeister.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Dave ‘Ceen my
glassesmeister’ arranged the luxury-not 4 seater bus.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>We would all surely be able to sue the driver for the effects of passive
smoking in years to come.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But, at
least he was reliable and on time, unlike Tim and Sean meisters who, as always,
arrived late at the airport.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">As usual the flight was delayed.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Regular updates were passed to us by JCmeister who spent most
of the time scrutinising the arrival time screen, not knowing if he was commin
or goin.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Only a half hour delay
though and we were finally up in the air.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Memories
of the Munich air disaster were recalled and its possible it might have got
mentioned to JCmeister once or twice to try and settle his nerves.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Just before we took off, the obligatory demonstration by the stewardess,
on ‘how to jump out of the plane if it was going to crash’, began and a
disturbance flared up close to the burra-wollers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>No, not JCmeister, but a group of rowdy nerds nearby who weren’t
listening to her demo.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We had an attractive looking stewardess in a tight fitting
red shirt, at our end of the plane, well we would wouldn’t we.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Sadly though, her armpits reeked with b.o. which Spikemeister remarked
upon on each occasion she reached over him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Don’t know how he could smell anything though; sitting so close to the
planes bog en housen.&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Safely arriving at Munich airport, Spikemeister, graciously
took over the purchasing of the train tickets.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Using techniques he had acquired over the years, wheeling and dealing, he
completely mesmerised the poor girl behind the ticket desk and somehow emerged
with a full complement of tickets for everyone.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Unfortunately, a line of frustrated germans, who had been patiently
waiting in the queue, were left fuming and cursing as the shutters dropped at
the ticket desk for the lunch break.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Don’t
mention ze var.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Separating on the tube, we arranged to meet up later at the
Ibis that afternoon to have a short ‘Fhart’ to suss out the fest for the
following day.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The 2 hotels were
streets apart, literally.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Ibis
was clean, but bijou, whereas the bogenhousen had swimming pools, buffets
available at all times which included endless supplies of sausages, that we
could only dream about in our bijou hotel.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We waited quietly and patiently in the bar waiting for the
CW’s and DC to rejoin us, sampling our first taste of german lager.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Keith Jackomeister insisted on using a disabled toilet instead of the
main one near the bar.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>He’d only had one stein by this point!<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Was the toilet disabled because it didn’t have any
lights?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Was Keith Jackomeister
after an early fhart?&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The first taste of german lager was very impressive, so
much so that a german slag gave us an earful and asked us to be quiet in a
‘Chell Heath/Bentilee cum German’ sort of way.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The burra wollers and D ‘Ceen my glassesmeister’ finally arrived to
meet us, having already snacked on the way.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>D ‘Ceen my glassesmeister’ and JCmeister had bought the last 2 slices
of pizza from a café, which were meant for Forest Gump who was next in line,
and he was none too pleased.&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The walk to the beer festival site was probably only a
couple of miles or so.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Amazing how
in that short time we could separate into two groups and lose each other.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Dragging Keith Jackomeister out of the peep shows didn’t help much.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Miraculously we met up again inside one of the many beer tents, and
regrouped.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The tents were massive
and absolutely packed with no apparent seating available.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>We eventually squeezed into a a beer garden.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Keith Jackomeister immediately made an impression on the gents, being
propositioned by at least 3 nice men.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Seanmeister
got the steins in and the singing began.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>‘Whale
meat again and oooh<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>oooh baby, oooh
arrrh.’&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Not feeling too well I excused myself from the table and
went a wandering.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>After feigning my
collapse in front of 2 young german lassies, blond, 18 years old, bikini-clad
(I’m dreaming again), and receiving treatment by the paramedics for extremely
low blood pressure, I returned unsteadily back to the tables where the ale had
began to pile up through my lack of normal consumption.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>It was time to leave.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This
was only supposed to be a taster of things to come tomorrow anyway.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Scottmeister though, had by this time become entangled with a group of
wenches on another table, (what a surprise) when a fracas began after some
german wolla nicked his stein.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Scottmeister
immediately de-capitated him and had to be rescued by the bouncers.&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The stagger back to the station was entertaining.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Keith Jackomeister was in the mood for pole dancing, although the bus
stop chosen did nothing for him, or us, except break his thumb; and give us
something to laugh about of course.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Food
at last, and my life back on track, I demolished a quick sandwich followed by a
bratwurst or two.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Still catching up
on food, I lost the rest of he gang, who unknowingly to me had climbed the
stairway to heaven, to reach ‘Burger King’, where Forest Gump re emerged.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Was he after revenge?&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Seemingly, I had mislaid my phone, so I staggered back to
the hotel accepting that I couldn’t do anything about it until light of day on
Friday.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>First task tomorrow, to
retrace my steps and find it.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Friday</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">At last, Hoffbrau beer tent day, after finding my mobile of
course.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">First stop, the lost property office at the train station.
Then the hot dog stand, then the sandwich shop, then, well we gave up.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>And, well would you believe it, Scottmeister had picked up my phone the
previous night, bless him.&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We set off from the hotel, aware that time was short to
meet up with the burra wollers and D ‘Ceen my glassesmeister’, as agreed at
10.30, managing to pick up a gallon or two of water up on the way to restock our
fluid levels.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>None of us were now
looking forward to a day of drinking; the last thing any of us now wanted after
the tank full necked the previous night.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
crowds swelled as we got closer to the site, passing a hotel with a board
outside upon which was written the following welcome message; ‘Welcome to our
hotel, but please don’t piss on the carpet.’<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A carnival atmosphere welcomed us with a delivery of
beer arriving outside our tent as we arrived, pulled by immaculately groomed
shire horses.&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The ‘tent’, similar to a giant aeroplane hanger, was
heaving already as we slipped inside to find our spot.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>A corner table on the balcony next to the steps had been reserved for us<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>ooooeer, it didn’t look good.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
nipped off to get the drink vouchers from a little office behind the bandstand
whilst the rest of the group rearranged a couple of tables to give us more room.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>With our vouchers in hand, the first steins were ordered and promptly
delivered to the table by our voluptuous waitress Nicole.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>As the atmosphere improved the activity on the stairs next to us grew and
our position didn’t appear quite so bad after all.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Messages began to appear on the mobiles asking what the cleavages were
like at our end of the table?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We’d
got ‘pole’ position.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Spikemeister,
being a little frustrated at the opposite end of the table, befriended a young
girl, and I mean young, around 6ish I would guess.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>He pretended to show her a few hand games, or so he told us!&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The chickens were hugemongous, and well worth waiting for.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I had to wait the longest mind, and after the previous days ‘lack of
food’ scare as well.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
table was slow to be cleared, so Spikemeister took on the job of stacking and
clearing the plates away.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Pam would
not have believed her eyes.&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">A wandering Neanderthal targeted D ‘Ceen my
glassesmeister’ asking him for a swig of his beer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>It must have been the glow of his generous nature and outwardly kind and
charitable personality shining through.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He
didn’t get any!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>D ‘Ceen my
glassesmeister’ promptly proposed Prague for next years jaunt to avoid the
prospect of ever meeting Neanderthal man again.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Before he got any response though, would you believe it, he
became targeted a second time, this time by Matteus whose soft lips were
puckered in an expectant manner waiting to accept whatever may be offered in his
direction.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He didn’t get anywhere
either!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Ein prosit and other Bavarian type songs ripped through the
air as the oompah band began to let rip.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
trips to the boggenhousen became more frequent, and the queues became longer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Some trips became more frequent for some, but they’ll remain nameless (JC/DC).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Now we’ve only got Scottmeister’s word on this, but he is adamant
that he spotted Richmeister being propositioned by Bob the Builder in the
bogenhousen.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Richmeister denies
this accusation of course.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>However,
Scottmeister would not tell fibs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>What
the ‘butler’ saw was a strapping big bloke, named ‘Dennis’, who was
wearing a yellow hard hat, planting a smacker on Richmeister at the urinal.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Say no more.&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">And then…<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>there she was…....<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>‘She
was stunningly beautiful, long blond hair, blue eyes, traditional dress, a
figure to die for, an understanding boyfriend and a cleavage photographed by us
all many, many times.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>better than a
f’ing good breakfast’.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Now who
was Spikemeister describing?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Was it
Samina, Sabrina, or Sardinia.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Whatever,
the race was on…..to name their first grand-daughter Sabrina.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Keith ‘I’m on for itmeister’<b> </b>swapped places
with her at one point on the balcony but no-one bothered to look at him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Scottie got his 2 cigars out to christen his grand daughter prematurely,
well he always is!<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>but unfortunately it was a no smoking area.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The steps were becoming perilously more wet and dangerous as the
afternoon wore on.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We laughed as
hundreds of drunken german slobs hit the slippery slope and broke their backs.
Were the steps wet from dripped ale or was it the dribbling from the mouths on
the balcony?&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The squabbles continued, …’Oh yes it is Sabrina, oh no
it’s not, its Samina, oh no it’s not………<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Who cares?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The cameras
flashed and clicked like never before.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Shares
in Kodak escalated 500%.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Samina’s
young boyfriend, Matteu, couldn’t understand the interest and was glad only of
the seats cleared for them next to Scottmeister.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Scottmeister, however, had his eyes fixated on a very nice man until he
discovered he was Indian and lost interest.&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Ale drank and it was time to be heading back to the hotel.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Seanmeister began to express his thanks to me for organising the trip and
became increasingly amorous; and aimed several sloppy kisses at me and hugged me
till I couldn’t breathe.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A quick
stop for a burger gave me chance to get my breath back and settle my nerves.&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Yet again the group had split into several groups.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Tim and Spikemeister had wandered off in one direction, Keith
Jackomeister in another and the rest of us returned back to the Italian
restaurant adjacent to our bijou hotel.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Richmeister was knackered and retired to bed at around
9.20pm, dreaming of Dennis and his shiny, hard…………..hat.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>We settled down in the Italian and pizzas were ordered.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Still full from the earlier burgers, we asked for them to be boxed up.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Surprisingly, D ‘Ceen my glassesmeister’ got a little narked with the
waiter for some reason and said he was toss.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Spikemeister wandered in.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Evidently,
Timmeister had returned back to his hotel for a midnight swim; and Keith <span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp;</span>Jackomeister had returned to the Ibis, promptly fell asleep in
his room and couldn’t be woken up by Spikemeister. <span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp;</span>It later emerged that Keith Jackomeister had tried another dry
run in a sex shop on the way back and despite his attempts, he never got to
‘Wank’ (a small village in Germany, incidently, near Fussen).&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<h2>Sat Fussen</h2>
<p class="MsoNormal">Breakfast began as previous with the buffet of various
hams, breads and cheeses.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A group
of Cossacks were popping tops off lager bottles to sober themselves up.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The burra wollers were tucking into full german breakfasts at their posh
hotel.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>JCmeister had taken a liking
to the sausages and had increased his intake by an extra length each day!</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Feeling a little jaded but eager to make the walk to the
castles we geared up and set off to the station.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Richmeister for some reason thought we were auditioning for
come dancing and had slipped on his tank top and ballroom shoes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Fear struck us as we realised that D ‘Ceen my glassesmeisters’
glasses had gone astray at the Italian last night.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>How would we be able to read any menus?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Surely that mad waiter, who D ‘Ceen my glassesmeister’ had described
as ‘toss’, hadn’t flattened them into someone’s pizza take-out?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>That reminded us, where were the pizzas that we were going to finish off
today? Had D ‘Ceen my glassesmeister’ eaten them before breakfast?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Apprehensively, we jumped aboard the train which was
sitting on a different platform to the one shown on the board, and hoped…<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Fussen was around 1½ hours away, so plenty of time for a nap.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The walk to the castles was only around 4-5 miles.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Long enough for Richmeister to break his shoes in with a cha-cha-cha and
a waltz.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>So impressed was
Scottmeister that he said he was going to buy some new boots for next years trip
and get Richmeister to break them in for him.&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">As the castles came into view, a bomber circled over to the
hum of the Dambuster’s tune.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Signs
in the adjacent wooded areas warned of Eagles landing, so JCmeister held on till
a public convenience became available because he’d heard that Eagles can spot
a 3mm branch from a mile away.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A
steep approach up to the castle and time enough for a look at the waterfall and
a bridge too far. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>On the bridge,
Scottmeister came over queer again.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It
was gorgeous, nicer than nice. The bridge that is !!&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In the castle, Neuschwanstein, D ‘Ceen my glassesmeister’
used his technical skills to aim at a wasp in the urinal.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Of course, we all thought he was taking the piss.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The tour was well worth waiting for and finally a chance to shop for
loved ones.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Well, Spikemeister must
have hundreds of them.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Timmeister had to wait at least half an hour for him to
appear with the key for the rucksacks, which had been deposited in the lockers
before entering the castle.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">On the return walk back to the village Timmeister
side-stepped a female cyclist to avoid getting mowed down, and was heard to
shout out ‘Danker’, or at least that’s what we thought he said.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The football results began to appear on D ‘Ceen my glassesmeister’
‘s mobile.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Stoke had beaten
Forest 2-1.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>D ‘Ceen my
glassesmeister’’s Rangers had lost 1-0 to Celtic.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Wolves had beaten Man City 1-0, but enough said about that.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Keegan had been given the boot by Man City and Sean began humming that
catchy little number again<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>oooh ooooh baby, oooh, aaah.&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">It didn’t take long to find a delightful restaurant in
Fussen.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In the style of a
banqueting hall, but complemented with a hairy transsexual.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Paper bibs were handed out by the friendly waitress.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>She must have been tipped off about our eating habits.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>We struggled to read the menus without D ‘Ceen my glassesmeister’
‘s glasses, which by now were probably lost forever.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>So we ordered the meals by instinct.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The meals were unusual to say the least.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>We’d agreed to have a snack only and wait till we were back in Munich
to dine out.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Soon forgotten, we
ordered main courses and a round of ale!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Spikemeister,
was so thirsty he ordered himself a further stein of extra dark beer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Scottmeister selected the Norwegian fish (Cod and chips) and JCmeister
ordered the hand reared Fussen chicken breast.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Over the 3 to 4 days break we reckon he’d eaten at least one, maybe 2
whole chickens.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Unfortunately,
they’d put a dollop of mayonnaise on his plate which JCmeister doesn’t like.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>So he scooped it up and flicked it over Seanmeister.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The train journey back saw Spikemeister nodding off.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>It must have been that extra dark dandelion and burdock he’d necked.&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We summoned up a few ounces of energy to have a quick look
around Munich when we got back and sauntered down the main street, past the
glockenspiel and into a bar.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Keith
‘I’m on for itmeister’<b> </b>sensed a little hostility in the room, so we
left before a war began.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Burger
King lured us in next door to order a snack, as it does.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Pondering the menu a german youth took a tumble and I was asked what I
was going to do about it!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>What was
all that about !! ??<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Is this how
wars start?&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The burra wollers and D ‘Ceen my glassesmeister’
returned to their hotel, or had D ‘Ceen my glassesmeister’ gone to a
different one.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Surely, it
couldn’t be the same hotel, because they’d got a buffet available, with
platefuls of sausages?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Apparently
it was the same one, because the Fanta machine was still there which JCmeister
had previously swore at because it wouldn’t work.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>D ‘Ceen my glassesmeister’ had explained to him that you have to
press a button on it and not a piece of card that had been stuck on the machine.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>If only either of them could have worked out the air-con in their room
then they wouldn’t have had to sleep naked every night!! Or would they??&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<h2>Sunday (final day)</h2>
<p class="MsoNormal">It was raining datsun cogs again, but this was our only
chance of snapping the glockenspiel and checking out a church service. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Back
at the hotel we started packing. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Like
a scene from Fawlty Towers, Keith Jackomeister began flapping and remonstrating
when he thought he’d lost his passport.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Not
only would he not get home, but he’d also got a holiday booked in Egypt the
following week.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Only in the civic
centre had such similar flapping scenes been seen before.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>It was in his pocket!!&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">A simple tube trip back to the airport proved a little
difficult, as we realised that we’d caught the correct ‘S1’ train, but
were travelling in the wrong direction. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Lo
and behold, we met up with the burra wollers on a platform.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>D ‘Ceen my glassesmeister’ was sporting a pair of pepperoni flavoured
reading glasses that had been found in a pizza box.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
&nbsp;</span>The delivery had only been made in a limousine, courtesy of the
burra wollers posh hotel.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>What
service is that?&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">JCmeister looked washed out, having had no sleep since
he’d arrived in Munich.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Each
night he’d screwed up the ‘Kleenex extra’ toilet paper and filled his ears
in an attempt to try and drown out the snoring from someone in the adjacent bed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>No not Keith ‘I’m on for itmeister’<b> </b>this time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>What made it worse was that the toilet paper was as rough as a bear’s
arse, not what you’d expect in a posh boggenhousen.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>At least it hadn’t been used.&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">No need to rush, as a 2 hour delay was announced at the
airport.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As we waited it became
apparent why Scottmeister’s case had been so light on the outward flight.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>It was filled with bubble wrap; enough to wrap every bottle in the duty
free shop in fact, and Phil’s ciggees.&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Finally on the aeroplane and seated with extra leg room, it
dawned on Keith Jackomeister that he’d been propositioned on 3 separate
occasions, sadly though by blokes on each occasion.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>To take his mind off it he replaced the emergency door sign
back on the door which had fallen off and smiled at JCmeister.&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">All’s well that ends well then, except for one final
problem…… Scottmeister had parked his car outside Beardies house over the
weekend but hadn’t told him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>His
neighbours had called the Police in.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Ooooops&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
