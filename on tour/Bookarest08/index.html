	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">Saturday began 
	very early as 9 of the team met at Westbury Tavern at 1: 45 a.m. </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">Yup sent 
	Dasher a text as the mini-bus arrived so that a swift pick up could be made 
	at The Meir but the message was lost in the ether and Steve was absent.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">It was 
	suggested by some that he would be finishing off a block paved drive, though 
	the general conclusion was that he was more likely to be finishing off 
	reading a book.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">Scottee mused 
	as we waited in the dark that Romanians would prove to be all like the 
	Cheeky Girls since they could not afford to eat.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">Dasher arrived 
	and the bus sped on to Uttoxeter to collect Sid for the journey to Luton as 
	we listened to Scottee�s reminiscences of his trip to the pyramids. He had 
	ridden on a camel named Moses and pointed out that few people were on first 
	name terms with a camel. Sid commented that his wife also went on one and 
	had asked �What about the smell�. The inevitable reply had been �The Camel 
	will soon get used to it�</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">Dawn broke as 
	we turned off the M1 and arrival at Luton Airport and fears that Wizz Air 
	was a one crate outfit were dispelled with a display of 4 modern planes in 
	purple livery.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">The flight to 
	Bucharest was undertaken in a haze of alternating consciousness as everyone 
	caught up with their lost sleep.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">Two mini buses 
	were waiting in the bright sunshine to make the 145km. trip to Brasov.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">Scottee 
	commented on the large number of S Class Mercedes �obviously bought with 
	cash meant for the orphanages but diverted�.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">The road to 
	Brasov was lined by neat but simple houses with buckets of fruit for sale 
	and vines in most gardens. The air-con ensured that a near freezing 
	temperature was maintained though Scottee considered it �ambient�.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">The route 
	passed abandoned factories next to an oil refinery with several miles of 
	�nodding donkey� oil well pumps.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">The route 
	through the Transylvanian Alps was spectacular with forests of red, gold and 
	green surmounted by high crags. A shepherd with 3 sheepdogs expertly herded 
	sheep alongside the fast flowing river while allegedly shouting �Let�s get 
	the flock out of here�</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">Our guide, 
	Vlad Coman, (not to be confused with his disreputable cousin Vlad Conman) 
	reported that the mountains extended to over 2,500 m. in height and that 
	cable cars were available.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">The buses 
	stopped at a roadside taverna named Casa Noastra in the ski resort of Sinaia 
	and 11 Ursus beers were quickly delivered.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">In preparation 
	to meet Dracula 10 �stakes� were ordered plus a calzone for the none red 
	meat eating Scottee.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">A sign 
	displayed draught beer at a bargain price but a request to the serving girl 
	was met by a very firm and loud <b>�NO�</b></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">Arrival in 
	Romania�s second City involved a sharp U turn to the Hotel Ambient for the 
	night.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">�A quick 
	shower and ablutions and meet in the lobby for <i>aperitif</i>� said Yup 
	�You will all have been supplied with <i>a pair of teeth</i>�.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">The first bar 
	was authentically Scottish with tartan decoration, beer at 6 lei a pint, a 
	good choice of whiskeys and run by an aggressive Glaswegian.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">The search for 
	something more ethnic led up an alleyway to a very small bar. The lady host 
	quickly stubbed out her fag and prepared to serve with a smoky smile but 
	could offer only bottled beer</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">We arrived at 
	the Taverna Sarbului (not to be confused with Sambuka) and settled down with 
	a beer costing 8 Lei a pint. (It should be noted here that the local 
	currency was 1 (new)Leu or, if plural, 10 (New)Lei with 1 Leu worth 25 
	pence. Beer at 8 Lei was thus around �2)</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">The menu 
	appeared expensive but came complete with pictures that provided 
	entertainment during the long wait before the food arrived. Scottee insisted 
	that his Wiener schnitzel had been made from chicken breast and not veal 
	though, judging by the size of it, it must have been a chicken with 
	implants.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">Yup�s meal was 
	not spicy enough but the �Serbian Bread� was good.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">11 meaty meals 
	+ beers cost 500 leu � around �11 each. It was Saturday night after all.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">Sunday 5<sup>th</sup> 
	October</span></b></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">The day 
	started early with a good breakfast that included bacon, chewy sausage and 
	scrambled egg. After the cake course mini pizzas and grilled eggs on toast 
	were added to the table to be stuffed down with the help of another cup of 
	coffee.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">Yup &amp; Stubbee 
	arrived at 9:35 for the agreed 8:30 meeting and were in so much of a rush 
	that Yup had to return to his room to collect the itinerary.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">Bill passed 
	the time struggling with his new mobile to change from predictive text to 
	normal. Keithee advised him that he needed a teenager. �That�s all teenagers 
	are good for - texting and fxxxing� he added.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">Vlad met us 
	with a large bus with a surly driver and seats that instantly reclined every 
	time Bill took a breath but was powerful enough to quickly climb into the 
	mountains for some spectacular views of Brasov in the mist.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">We made our 
	way to the ski centre at Poiana Brasov and on through the rain towards Bran 
	Castle.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">Our Vlad 
	informed us that the Impaler Vlad had been imprisoned in the Castle for 
	three weeks during 1377 though his castle lay elsewhere. Bran Castle had 
	been equipped with 55 cannons to guard the entrance to Transylvania.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">We climbed the 
	slippery steps up to the entrance where Jacko took a tumble, Bill took his 
	hood off to reveal his grey hair to qualify for a pensioner rate and Scottee 
	took a photo of a nice pair of knockers on the door.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">The castle had 
	been the home of the Romanian Royal Family until the 1940�s and, though 
	sparsely furnished, was adorned by photos of the last Queen in various 
	Hollywood type poses. It was fairy tale cute and contained all the right 
	ingredients including a secret stairway within a wall.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">Scottee and 
	Richie sheltered from the rain under an overhanging projection in the cliff 
	face as the rest got wet contemplating the meaning and timing of fate.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">The side shows 
	were grouped in the square and included the usual tatty souvenirs, genuine 
	plastic Dracula relics and an old lady proudly displaying her wares that 
	included a bucket of apples, walnuts and pots of honey.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">We paid our 
	Lei and entered the House of Horrors via a bridge within a rotating drum 
	that induced each visitor to cling onto the hand rail to counter the 
	disorientating spinning effect while trying to avoid decorating the drum 
	with pavement pizza.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">The displays 
	were simple but effective and included live but severed heads and impaled 
	torsos. The coffin lid opened and the vampire sat up like a coiled spring 
	but the action caused so much vibration he appeared to masturbxxx as he 
	rose. Dirty sod!</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">We were aware 
	that Elf �n Safety rules had probably not yet been adopted in the new Europe 
	as we made our way into a chamber with a Werewolf in a pit but equipped with 
	a vicious looking pitchfork.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">Yup had the 
	willies well and truly put up him as he tried to escape the range of the 
	pitchfork. He escaped to the corner but the werewolf merely climbed the 
	balustrade to threaten him as he cowered and was only saved by the sound of 
	the approaching Steve as the werewolf shrank back into the shadows in order 
	to greet his next guest.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">Yup made well 
	his escape and checked the cleanliness of his trousers as he watched in 
	delight as the werewolf startled Steve.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">Club Villa 
	Bran lay off a narrow track beyond a farmyard. The track was so steep that 
	steel bars had been set into the concrete ramp to form a ladder but had been 
	ripped out by traffic to leave jagged projections. </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">Expectations 
	were justifiably low but were soon lifted as we entered the restaurant which 
	appeared to be a grand hunting lodge constructed of tree trunks and 
	branches.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">The walls were 
	built of cut logs set in mortar and a huge open fire burned logs in the 
	central area with smoke rising through a stone chimney hung by chains from 
	the high ceiling.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">We were 
	ushered to an upstairs table with spectacular views of Bran Castle set 
	within the tree clad mountains.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">Yup lifted his 
	ban on starters and ordered a soup but Scottee confessed that he had no 
	appetite after he had perhaps over indulged at breakfast with cakes and 
	cheeses followed by more cakes and pastries. �He was now full of shit.� 
	remarked Keithee. </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">Craig also 
	claimed to have little appetite but ordered a vast wooden platter of 
	�tortacello� </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">The Chef�s 
	special turned out to be orange tennis balls of polenta (made of maize meal) 
	with <b>heavy </b>garlic presumably to ward off the vampires</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">Scottee 
	observed that the locals were all very fit and considered it was all due to 
	clean mountain air and goat�s cheese as he helped Richie to pour his beer. 
	He spoiled the assistance by dropping the bottle to break a plate and 
	spilling the beer.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">Richie 
	sentenced him to be impaled.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">The meal and 
	wine turned out to be too good and we dallied so long that Vlad�s schedule 
	faltered.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">A reindeer 
	bade us farewell to rejoin the previously empty roads that were now busy and 
	traffic jams slowed our progress while Bill continued to break more seats.
	</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">�I shall write 
	to Mercedes about these seats� he said.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">Perles Castle 
	stood magnificently within a landscaped estate but had closed its doors for 
	the day. The caf� was simple but inviting though the hostess caused some 
	confusion by quoting prices in old leu. The cost of the Ursus beer proved 
	cheap when the price was divided by 1000.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">The bus began 
	the journey back to Bucharest but as he turned a corner in Sinaia the 
	driver�s view was so masked by his windscreen collection of charms and St. 
	Christopher medallions that he nearly hit a couple on the zebra crossing.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">The journey 
	back through the oil fields was one long traffic jam enlivened only by 
	Richie�s tirade regarding the meaning of �a 50% chance of precipitation� so 
	that we arrived at the Hotel Rembrandt bored, tired and thirsty.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">Rooms were 
	quickly taken with Axe allocated a penthouse with a balcony.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">Every room 
	came equipped with double beds that were dismantled within seconds of 
	arrival to make twin beds and furniture rearranged to make barriers between.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">A quick visit 
	to the Hotel bar for the complimentary drink followed by several more 
	uncomplimentary ones preceded the excursion to Caru� cu Bere </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">The restaurant 
	was definitely the place to see and to be seen in.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">Scottee 
	pondered whether the building style was Baroque, Rococo or Art Nouveau? Bill 
	declared it to be Victorian Gothic and definitely impressive.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">Several girls 
	in gypsy dress appeared to be in charge. The head girl wore flat shoes but 
	would have stood a fully metricated 2 metres tall in high stiletto sling 
	backs and fish net stockings. She allowed us to stand by the ladies loo that 
	doubled as a confessional box while we fantasised and considered our 
	options.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">A large table 
	was soon cleared and we settled in with litre steins of beer while Steve 
	resisted the urge to order a lemonade side order.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">Yup ordered 
	chicken while most went for fish on the proviso that it did not come with 
	polenta. </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">A wonderful 
	spread was presented though only Steve�s sizzler was warm. Stubee asked for 
	more bread that never arrived and left him feeling hungry.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">The time must 
	have passed quickly and it appeared as if suddenly everyone, including the 
	girls, had left and the waiter turned cold and unfriendly.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">The meal 
	including 1� litres of beer and several glasses of wine cost 75 lei each.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">We reflected 
	on the good value as we sipped Jack Daniels at 26 lei back at the Rembrandt 
	bar.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">Monday 6<sup>th</sup> 
	October. Bucharest</span></b></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">Breakfast was 
	displayed in the bar and included a Tupperware type boiled egg cradle 
	containing 5 (presumably half a metric dozen) eggs firmly welded to each 
	other with boiled egg white.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">We set off to 
	University Square to explore the building site that was the Metro system but 
	no maps or directions were available. </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">Jacko lost 
	orientation in his visit underground and strode off in a new direction.
	</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">The shortcut 
	through the park to get back to Revolution Square proved a worthwhile break 
	from the traffic as we relaxed in the caf� by the fountain in the lake. 
	Scottee and Craig ordered orange while the rest chose coffee.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">There appeared 
	to be no pavement cafes or bars to sit at and watch the world go by and 
	little to ogle even if there had been.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">Axe found The 
	Winston Churchill Bar and considered it unpatriotic to pass by.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">Two beers each 
	plus Bailey�s and sambukas for the Beardy boys were drunk before the bill 
	was carefully apportioned and settled.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">Stubee, the 
	king of the kebab, led the way over the road to a Turkish takeaway and 
	ordered an Eastern concoction using a mixture of sign language and pointing.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">However �hold 
	the mayo� could not be transmitted or interpreted and Stubee walked away 
	with a gift wrapped soggy envelope.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">Eager to avoid 
	the sign language most merely pointed at the Stubeekebab and nodded for a 
	repeat complete with generous dollops of minty yoghurt and sauerkraut.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">Jacko found a 
	comfortable section of kerb and sat down to carefully unwrap his parcel but, 
	unfortunately, opened the wrong end so that the contents of the already 
	sodden bundle ruptured to release the contents over his crotch and he was 
	forced to spend the rest of the day looking all overcome with a very 
	suspicious white stain.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">Scottee 
	avoided the queue by buying from another greasy spoon round the corner and 
	settled down to eat it on the step to a flower shop.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">The irate 
	florist appeared with a broom and berated Scottee about the communal mess 
	that surrounded him. Scotee protested his innocence but, as he did so, 
	dropped a soggy lump of his Turkish delight and was lucky to escape without 
	a brush round his ear.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">The general 
	conclusion was tasteless, disappointing and lacking spice.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">The Indian 
	Restaurant was found and a reservation made for 11 at 9:00 p.m. though the 
	owner believed the reservation to be only a distraction story to allow the 
	group to visit his loo.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">Satisfied that 
	we had probably done the town we set off back via a stop for Yup to make his 
	traditional purchase of local vodka.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">A quick power 
	nap and shower was all that was needed before a re-group in the bar where 
	the new barmaid offered a choice of dark or blonde. A couple from Canada had 
	booked into the hotel and enquired about the Squarry Club. Not only were 
	they familiar with the game but they owned their own Squash courts.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">Jacko led the 
	way to the Metro at Piata Unirii and purchased a ticket for 11 that had to 
	be passed 11 times through the automatic entrance gate.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">The nearest 
	station to the Indian was Obor which was in the far North East to our 
	starting point in the South so that any train in either direction seemed OK.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">The first 
	train in was boarded and we set off in a clockwise direction around the City 
	to eventually arrive at Obor to begin the long trek Southwards to the Haveli 
	heritage cuisine restaurant which lay behind the Indian Embassy and could 
	therefore be assured to be authentic.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">The table for 
	11 was ready with a large �Reserved� notice and our waitress, Angelina, 
	quickly served the first beers.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">Axe commented 
	that he had been married for 15 years. To the question �Did you get your 
	crystal wedding gift?� he replied �No, just the Solicitor�s bill�.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">Keithee 
	remarked that it was a wonder that Yup had kept his figure with all the food 
	he ordered. Scottee noted that Yup had an hour glass figure- with all the 
	sand at one end.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">The meals were 
	served in small balti dishes all as ordered but were all lukewarm.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">Jacko managed 
	to rub a chilli pepper into his eye and had to be led to the loo by Sid so 
	that he could wash his already closing eye. �It�s just as well you hadn�t 
	rubbed your penis and made that shrink� said Keithee. �You should have 
	rubbed your brain and made that smart instead�. �Or perhaps they are the 
	same organ� he added.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">Scottee was 
	wearing his locally bought after shave which was guaranteed to result in sex 
	late at night.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">The long walk 
	back to the hotel was along by now familiar streets and even the underpass 
	construction site seemed ordinary.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">Tuesday 7<sup>th</sup> 
	October. Bucharest</span></b></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">Breakfast was 
	again taken in the mezzanine bar where Bill again bumped his head on the 
	beam every time he filled his plate. It was rather like being on an aversion 
	therapy diet.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">The night had 
	been warm and muggy so that windows in all rooms had been opened and 
	everyone had been bitten by mosquitoes.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">However 
	Scottee claimed that he had been saved from being bitten either because of 
	his sex spray or that Richie had proved much more �juicier� to the insects.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">Suitcases were 
	packed and rooms vacated by 11:00 in readiness for the final day in the 
	city. </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">The main 
	square was busy but unexciting. We stood by the turning point for the trams 
	and noted that the drivers were all burly women.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">The tree lined 
	mall leading to Parliament Palace was spacious with wide pavements but with 
	few cafes and little atmosphere.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">The Plaza in 
	front of the Palace contained a stage from which loud music was being played 
	while beyond lay dozens of old buses with filthy interiors.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">The sound of a 
	chanting mob could be heard approaching and a concerned security guard 
	advised our absence. Observers stood at every prominent place on the 
	rooftops surrounding the Plaza and Richie made some loud reference to sniper 
	fire. Not wanting to become part of the protesting rabble we moved off 
	towards the Palace entrance.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">The Palace 
	visit was only possible by guided tour but only 4 tickets were available.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">Subbee, Bill, 
	Keithee and Jacko were first in the queue and paid their 15 lei entrance.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">Jacko was 
	frisked by the guard who was particularly interested in the Dracula teeth 
	that he could feel in his pocket through the fleece. </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">The Palace was 
	built under the orders of Nicolae Ceausescu to house all the offices of the 
	communist state but was now occupied by the Romanian Parliament with much of 
	the building unused. Built on a vast scale in the wedding cake style 
	favoured by Stalin and constructed almost totally in marble the guide, 
	Bogdan, rattled off endless superlatives regarding quantities and 
	dimensions.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">A succession 
	of grand marble staircases and vast halls were presented until we reached 
	the balcony for the impressive view down The Mall towards the City Centre.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">Bogdan 
	informed us that Ceausescu had never addressed his people from the balcony. 
	The only person to make the address had been Michael Jackson during his 
	world tour in 1988 though he had spoilt the occasion by calling �Hello 
	Budapest� to the massed throng. Good old wacko Jacko.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">Protests 
	during 1989 had been met by gunfire and thousands may have died at the hands 
	of the secret police. However in the closing days of that year a revolution 
	was accomplished and Ceausescu was executed alongside his wife by firing 
	squad.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">We gathered 
	back together in the newly pedestrianised street leading to the hotel and 
	settled down to beers and pasta.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">In order to 
	preserve traffic free conditions a compressor had been set at the bottom of 
	the hill to blow fly ash the short distance to a shop undergoing 
	refurbishment though the hose was some metres short. Three men were required 
	to load the downhill hopper and a further 4 to shovel the ash from the 
	discharge point to the shop doorway. The operation was further complicated 
	by frequent blockages that needed to be cleared.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">An old man 
	passed up the hill every 5 minutes pushing a wheelbarrow loaded with one bag 
	of cement to return empty. He was either restocking the builder�s yard at 
	the top of the hill or he was the major distributor in a thriving 
	wheelbarrow trade. A real one wheeler dealer.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">Steve�s 
	stomach cramps and his fears of an impending laundry problem forced him to 
	seek refuge in the toilet of Craig�s room that he had negotiated to retain 
	for an additional night.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">Yup was also 
	suffering and set off to climb into Craig�s bed even if Craig was already 
	there.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">The group was 
	therefore split into three with the invalids in the hotel, the Beardy boys 
	in search of cheap beer and the remainder off for a final culture tour of 
	the City.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">The Beardy 
	boys met up with a Romanian now living in New York but back on vacation and 
	had learnt of the crazy rise and spectacular fall of local property prices.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

	<img border="0" src="https://baltibugle.co.uk/on tour/Bookarest08/halloween13.gif" width="278" height="261" align="left"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">We approached 
	Dracula�s restaurant with teeth carefully hidden but found the door would 
	not open. 
	<img border="0" src="https://baltibugle.co.uk/on tour/Bookarest08/ANIhandCandle2C.gif" width="92" height="173" align="right" hspace="1" vspace="1"></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">The restaurant was so small that the door had been converted to 
	slide sideways but succeeded in fooling everyone who tried to enter or 
	leave. They must have lost many potential customers.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">We were 
	ushered to our table that completely filled the largest room to be welcomed 
	by our host and introduced to our guide for the night. </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">The guide was 
	dressed in full Hammer Horror cape and make up and was genuinely weird as he 
	told the Dracula legend in a voice reminiscent of Peter Laurie.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">However he 
	interpreted the pained expressions of the stomach gripes as disinterest and 
	gave up.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">Yup and 
	Stubbee were the first to be rendered helpless by the mystery bug followed 
	by Steve to reduce the party to 8. Craig then left with an unusually quiet 
	Richie to leave 6.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">A census among 
	those remaining revealed only Axe and Scottee to be �chipper�.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">The food 
	arrived in unusual presentations with lots of meat impaled on a scaffold of 
	spikes over a burning pot of lamp oil the smell of which permeated the meal.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">
	<img border="0" src="https://baltibugle.co.uk/on tour/Bookarest08/Dracula_gifs_30.gif" width="134" height="170" align="left">Dracula 
	arrived and enunciated in a loud voice like a true thespian drama queen.<img border="0" src="https://baltibugle.co.uk/on tour/Bookarest08/ANIfangChomp4C.gif" width="78" height="61" align="right"></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">He seemed not 
	to notice his audience staring back at him with fixed stares and prominent 
	vampire fangs and continued dropping copious amounts of candle wax all over 
	his cape from the candelabra he held high above himself.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">He ushered us 
	down into the dungeon and chose Sid and Bill to pose with him for photo 
	opportunities as he boomed a diatribe in perfect English.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">The return to 
	the hotel was taken at a leisurely pace; after all we had another 5 hours to 
	wait, as we detoured to find a cash machine for Axe.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">Wednesday 8<sup>th</sup> 
	October.</span></b></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">We returned to 
	the hotel bar and settled down to wait for the taxis. Scottee played 
	chequers with Keithee and quickly learned the rules. �I�m better at chess� 
	he claimed and was again challenged by Keithee.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">One game was 
	lost before Scottee finally got his eye in to produce a stalemate.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">Two young 
	couples turned up at 2:00 to negotiate rooms for the night though they were 
	clearly not for catching up with their sleep.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">The invalids 
	assembled and Richie lifted his shirt to reveal that he had indeed proved 
	�juicy� with a display of festering mosquito bite marks stretching over a 
	wide arc across his back. </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">The sickness 
	was variously attributed with some blaming the minty yoghurt of the dodgy 
	kebab; some cited the mosquitoes while others considered that the curry had 
	been truly Indian even down to the authentic �Delhi belly�.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">Three taxis 
	arrived though Keith insisted it was still Tuesday.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">One driver 
	looked remarkably like Henri Paul and confirmed the suspicions of madness by 
	speeding off with a flurry of wheel spin to 130 km/hr over the cobbles of 
	the otherwise deserted streets.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">As soon as he 
	encountered tarmac he accelerated to 160 so that we made the 20 minute run 
	to Henri Coanda airport in less that 5.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">We boarded the 
	plane for the return to find access to the extra legroom seats by the 
	emergency exit blocked by an unusually burly hardman flight attendant.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">Bill had a 
	quiet word in his ear and he saw Bill�s point of view and relented so that 
	Bill was able to stretch out while Steve was allowed to accompany him with 
	an annoying grin.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">On arrival at 
	Luton Yup rang the taxi to learn that the driver had been involved in a 9 
	car shunt on the M1 but would get us home somehow.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">The minibus 
	arrived with bits flapping in the wind and steam coming from the radiator.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">Richie quickly 
	packed the luggage with an efficiency he put down to years of playing Tetrus.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">�I�ll just 
	crash out on the way home� said Scottee in an unfortunate turn of phrase 
	while Axe contemplated staying in Luton in readiness for the London outing.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">The bus limped 
	to Toddington, the first services on the M1, and Craig was kept busy filling 
	water bottles to top up the radiator as Yup helped by taking a photo. 
	However the burst was losing as fast as Craig could replenish and we set off 
	once more.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">We bumped and 
	limped on to Rugby where we transferred to another independently operated 
	bus called in by our unfortunate driver. The second driver was a merry sole 
	who cheerfully informed the fist driver that his rear sub frame had broken 
	with the result that the bus was a write off. �You�d be better off 
	abandoning it here� he suggested.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">We continued 
	home as Yup sweet talked the second driver with the consolation prize that 
	he could be offered the contract to ferry the Squarry Club on its future 
	outings</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">What a 
	wonderful end to a superbly organised trip.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
