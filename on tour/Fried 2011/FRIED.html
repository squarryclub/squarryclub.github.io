<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><st1:City w:st="on">Roseville</st1:City>�s finest carriage
arrived at Sandbach to collect the Keiths to carry the Squarrites Northwards
through red traffic lights to <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Manchester</st1:PlaceName>
 <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Airport</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Flight tickets were issued and, by good luck, Dasher was
able to provide Bill�s missing papers from his own collection that he had been
able to stuff into his new and smaller suitcase. He was so pleased to have
dispensed with his usual bright yellow hard case that he elected to carry the
new one on board as hand luggage.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sid checked his paperwork and selected his front pocket to
carry his wallet. �You may still meet pickpockets but at least you get touched
up in the process� he explained.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>�</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>All went well at passport control even though some were
asked to �assume the position indicated� in front of the new �see through
clothes machine�. You could almost hear the sound of far off laughter.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Dasher�s option to carry his case appeared unwise as he was
made to dispose of all liquids including deodorants. He took one last long blast
and hoped that the effects would last for 4 days. �One small spray for Dasher, one
long smell for the rest� noted Yup. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Keithee was reportedly relieved to hear that Steve had been
able to retain his Vaseline.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There was an opportunity for Yup to open his account book
and settle outstanding debts for the Mystery Christmas trip, taxi fares and
shirts before a slightly delayed boarding</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There was the usual free for all to board the plane but Bill
found a seat by the emergency door with extra leg room. Yup came as part of the
offer and sat beside him to drink a couple of whiskeys. Keithee and Dasher sat
together drinking red wine while the rest sat wherever they could find a place.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The terminal at <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Zurich</st1:place></st1:City>
appeared to be a satellite connected to the main airport building by underground
rail. The trains ran at 4 minute intervals and entertained travellers with
typical Swiss background noises of alpine cow bells, yodelling and perhaps the
more subtle sound of money being counted.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Return tickets for the train to Romanshorn and ferry to <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Friedrichshafen</st1:place></st1:City> were
purchased at a cost of 74 Swiss Franks or 65 Euros. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The train was just leaving from platform 1 so that a one
hour wait had to be taken with a few beers at the Caf� Spettacola in the concourse.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Several large ladies passed to prompt Sid to comment that
�You know when your wife is fat when she sits on your face and you can�t hear
the stereo.�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Richie replied �You know when your wife is dead. The sex is
the same but the ironing keeps building up.�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Romanshorn appeared to be a pleasant, quiet town with lots
of bicycles but little traffic. Yup lead the way around the back streets until
he found a small bar claiming to sell pizzas.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The youth at the counter spoke no English and gestured that either
the till was locked or he had no change. He was able to provide beer to be
drunk in the sunshine while perving at the locals through gaps in the plastic
raffia screens. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A young Swiss maid arrived to translate and take the orders.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Most ordered a small pizza at 8 francs while Jacko and Bill
shared a gross special at 12 francs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>However Jacko�s careful division to ensure even distribution
of the artichoke and pepperoni was clumsy and resulted in a cascade of greasy cheese
and tomato down his white trousers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The sun was sinking over the rooftops as the ferry left for <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Germany</st1:place></st1:country-region> and all
went well until the ticket inspector appeared. Jacko panicked as he searched
all of his 9 pockets twice over. The combined return ticket was missing and
there was no one else he could blame.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The inspector took pity on his miserable face and walked
away.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Evening had fallen when the Squarrites landed in <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Friedrichshafen</st1:place></st1:City> to drag
their cases along the lakeside promenade. Dasher spotted the sign for the Hotel
City Krone (Crown) and a rapid check in was made.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Rooms were allocated </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:2'>����������������������� </span>307<span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:72.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A meeting in the hotel bar was arranged for a few beers
before a quick exploration of the town with a pint in the underground disco pub
before returning to the Pier 40 bar opposite the Hotel. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The bar was full of winos and weirdos and showed female
wrestlers on the TV above the head of the well tattooed barmaid. The Squarrites
quickly felt at home.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There was no evidence of the �master race� as the locals
smoked and stared wildly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Richie soon struck up a conversation with the bar
intellectual that revolved around the merits of area bombing in WW II.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>Tuesday 4<sup>th</sup>
October<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The day began with cold showers for everyone though Dasher
had been able to swim a couple of lengths of the pool before a warm shower in
his speedos.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Breakfast was the usual Continental style but there was
bacon that was chewy but tasty. The boiled eggs were raw though the scrambled
egg was plentiful.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Yup noted that Keithee had yoghurt in his ear. �Sorry, I�m a
trifle deaf.� was the reply.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Yup lead the way to the Tourist Information to inquire about
routes to Bregenz (11 Euros by train) in <st1:country-region w:st="on">Austria</st1:country-region>
and the <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Rhine</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Falls</st1:PlaceType>
in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Switzerland</st1:place></st1:country-region>
(29 Euros by coach).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The journey to Bregenz involved a change at Lindau but the
times of the trains were arranged to avoid any waiting. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Keithee sat by the window and saw the platform sign �Lindau
Auten� and made for the door followed by Jacko and a backpacker.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>No sooner had Keithee left the train the automatic door
started to close. The backpacker pushed forward and was lucky not to have his
load guillotined from his back as the sliding door closed tightly and the train
moved off.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The remaining Squarrites waved goodbye and the driver gave a
happy toot on his horn.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>On the platform Keithee and the backpacker stared at the
overgrown and deserted station then stared at each other. Neither spoke the
other�s language and both were clearly lost.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Yup received a text from Keithee as the Squarrites arrived at
Lindau Hbf. The message read �Have we got a plan.�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Luckily Yup and Steve did have a plan and quickly set off in
a taxi through the suburbs to collect him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The remainder sat by the harbour with a cool beer at the
Dash Garten and watched the world go by in the warm sunshine.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The team returned successfully and were surprised that the
taxi driver spoke good English. His wife was a Yokshire lass.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The taxi fare was apportioned before boarding the train to
Bregenz to join the cable car up the mountain. Tickets were bought at a cost of
10 Euros though the pensioners got a 1 Euro discount.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There was a collection of boars and mountain goats in
enclosures behind the Berghof.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Richie commented on the height of the fences and was assured
by Sid that the fence was the very one jumped by Steve McQueen on his motor
bike.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The descent was orderly despite some last minute loo visits
and beers were ordered at the lakeside restaurant by the station.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The pork escallops were superb and were followed by more
beer and apple strudel.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The waitress asked Yup if he wanted fresh cream, whipped
cream or ice cream?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Dasher replied for all �The lot please�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A zeppelin flew over to complete the happy scene.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The train from Bregenz was 5 minutes late in leaving and in
danger of missing the connection at Lindau Hbf. The train came in and Yup lead
the rush across the platform to board a train marked �<st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Stuttgart</st1:place></st1:City>�. �Even if the train doesn�t stop
the Beer Festival is on� said Yup.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Everyone looked out as the team passed Keithees favourite
station but there was no sign of the abandoned backpacker or of any tear stains
on the platform.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The sun shone through the windows as one by one everyone
nodded off into a half limbo of sleep.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>At Friedrichshafen Yup consulted the Tourist Information to
find the best route to Meersburg.<span style='color:red'>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Zeppelin</st1:PlaceName>
 <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Museum</st1:PlaceType></st1:place> offered reduced
visitor charges after 4:00 but closed at 5:00.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Yup�s timing was spot on.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Museum information boards were mainly in German with
only trivial bits in English. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Zeppelin must have been a massive investment during the
1930�s with evidence of the global network of terminals and anchorage pylons.
The frames were built of aluminium lattice space frames riveted together. One
engine pod had been preserved and Richie went to touch the flimsy covering to the
sound of warning bells and much German remonstration.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A mock up of the interior showed a lounge with a grand
piano, bedrooms and a dining room. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>�</span>They must have seemed
the way of the future at the time and certainly had benefits over modern long
hauls.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There was only scant mention of the fate of the hydrogen
filled Hindenburg with the inferno at <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Lakehurst</st1:City>,
 <st1:State w:st="on">New Jersey</st1:State></st1:place> in 1937.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:red'>(The Hindenburg was the largest
Zeppelin ever. It was 972 feet long and weighed 110 tons. Its 7 million cubic
feet of hydrogen caught fire at a height of 300 feet when wet mooring ropes
conducted static electricity. Though it carried 97 people only 33 people were
killed)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The evening was spent with an amble along the promenade to
the <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Marina</st1:place></st1:City> bar
where Richie ordered a Cosmopolitan with extra ice while the remainder settled
for a large bottle of wheat beer at 4 Euros each. A group of Americans bowled
10 pins in the adjacent room.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The hungry Squarrites went in search of food but the kebab
house was shutting at its advertised time of 10:00. A quick dash to McDonalds
at the station proved an equal failure.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The �Ristorante Trulli� was still open and fired up the
pizza oven.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>Wednesday 5<sup>th</sup>
October<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>� </span><o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The day began with an early start and another cold shower </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The �Funk Tour� coach arrived outside the rail station and
the driver introduced himself in good English that he had learnt when he had
lived in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">America</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
His lapel badge pronounced his name to be Hams J Buhner but from the back he
was surely Leslie Neilson (but don�t call him Shirley).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Additional passengers were collected on the route west and Hams
entertained his passengers with happy banter in German only. He was so good
that the Squarrites laughed along with the Germans. It was the way he told
them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The route crossed a causeway stabilised by an avenue of
poplars to an area once surrounded by the lake infested by symbolic serpents.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The World Heritage site of Reichenau contained the priory of
St. Mary &amp; <st1:place w:st="on">St.</st1:place> Marks.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hams invited the passengers to see the �Tweezers�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>�The Tweezers?�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>�Yes� said Hams �The Church�s Tweezers�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>�The <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Church</st1:PlaceType>
 of <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">St Theresa</st1:PlaceName></st1:place>?�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>�No� said Hams �the gold tweezers, the tweezers of gold and
jewels�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>�Ah!� cried the Squarrites �The Church Treasures.�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>After such a big build up the treasures turned out to be a
disappointing collection of relics of Saints alleged bones and toenails
together with ornamental gold covered arcs. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One cabinet claimed to contain Kaiser Karl�s 13kg, 3cm dick.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The journey continued into <st1:country-region w:st="on">Switzerland</st1:country-region>
to the town of <st1:City w:st="on">Stein</st1:City> am Rhine to prompt Stubbee
to break into song, �The Stein on the Rhine is all mine all mine�<span
style='color:red'> (<st1:place w:st="on">Lindisfarne</st1:place> 1971)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hams lead the way to �a cheap place to eat� rather that the
expensive places in the town centre. The way led past a house with a field gun
in the garden. Hams explained that all Swiss men between the ages of 18 and 45
were enlisted in the army and were required to keep a gun at home. This, he
joked, was an example.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The restaurant was in the open air by the river and served
traditional Swiss cuisine such as spaghetti and pizza.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Most went for Spaghetti Bolognese that came with a grate
your own parmesan grater.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The town was delightful and chocolate box pretty.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The coach toured on to the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName
 w:st="on">Rhine</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Falls</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>
and tickets were bought for the boat ride to the island in the falls.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The landing and stairways were crowded but well built with
firm handrails made of stainless steel. One woman carried her infant high on
her shoulders.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sid took a deep breath in the spray. �Warmer than the
showers in the Hotel� he said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Richie wondered if salmon could jump such a waterfall. �No
trouble� said Keithee �They make it all the way to the top shelf at Tesco�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Squarrites boarded the ferry and looked back in awe.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>�</span>�Imagine you were
coming up the river in a <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Lancaster</st1:City></st1:place>
bomber and that was the result� said Sid.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hams returned the Squarrites back to the station where Jacko
was able to buy a combined ferry/rail ticket to <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Zurich</st1:place></st1:City> for 24.8 Euros.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Back to the Hotel where Yup decided to go for a swim but was
distracted by 2 blonde Teutonic beauties lying in the sauna area with only small
towels strategically placed to cover their modesty. Yup was too much of a
gentleman to look but it did put him off his swimming. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Squarrites decided to return to explore Lindau during
the evening and Sid soon mastered the machine at the station to buy tickets at
cost of 10.6 Euros. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The first stop was at the lushes bar next to Lindau station.
The locals were friendly enough and Richie avoided mentioning the war. The
bottled beer was cheap, tasty and 8.5% alcohol.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The route to the Irish bar was tortuous but did allow a
deeper study of the beautiful town with cobbled streets and architectural gems.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A girl with caterpillar eyebrows at the Irish bar served
Kilkenny and Guinness while Bill and Jacko stayed with the wheat beer. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Club sandwich and chips were taken to soak up the beverage.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Yup saved the day again and shepherded the Squarrites back
to the station in time to catch the otherwise empty 11:30 train to return to
the hotel 12:10.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Another early start with cold showers to board the ferry
bound for <st1:place w:st="on">Constance</st1:place>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The fare to Meersburg was 8.5 Euros and Yup collected 10
from each Squarrite and paid the captain. The change was donated to Jacko
towards his ticket home and was gratefully received.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The sun shone brightly as most sat on tiers of benches
facing the back of the ferry watching people and herons.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Meersburg was pretty and well decorated with flowers. A
winery with a grape crusher was sited in the middle of the town and the
Squarrites lingered to take in the fermentation aromas.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The way to the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Meersburg</st1:PlaceName>
 <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Castle</st1:PlaceType></st1:place> led up a steep
path through a well guarded vineyard.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Castle claimed itself to be the oldest inhabited castle
in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Germany</st1:place></st1:country-region>
dating back to around 1000 a.d.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A programme had been provided and each Squarrite read the
appropriate section to each numbered station.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The dungeon was particularly interesting and appeared to
have only one access through an open hole in the floor through which prisoners
were lowered on a wooden bar 9 metres to the floor.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><st1:place w:st="on"><st1:country-region w:st="on">Germany</st1:country-region></st1:place>�s
greatest poet of the 19<sup>th</sup> Century, Annette von Droste-Hulshoff, had
lived in the castle for 7 years and her deathbed (1841) took pride of display.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Yup admired the Basil Fawltey moose and other antlers on the
wall but accepted that they were too dear.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The caf� on the castle terrace was bathed in sunshine as the
Squarrites took a break with light refreshment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The team continued on up the hill to catch the bendy bus from
the stop by the church.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The fare was cheap and proved even cheaper when the driver
gestured that the charge was for a group of four.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sid led the way to the station and, with the skills he�d
learnt the previous day, soon had the tickets for Lindau from the machine timed
at 15:33</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jacko commented that most of his photos had been of
Squarrites as they walked away. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It was in such ways that he had first learnt of his own
baldness. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>�Full hair from the front but like a baboon�s arse from the
back� said Sid.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Depends which way round you�re looking said Keithee.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Lindau was just as pretty but the Irish bar was closed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Beers at Hugo�s were taken in the street as the rain began
to fall.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Irish bar opened at 17:00 and several beers were taken with
a communal plate of chips.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There was a feel of autumn in the air and someone mentioned
Christmas prompting Keithee to comment that he had been so upset to learn the
truth about Santa Clause that he had to have a day off work.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The journey back had a musical theme with Sid�s �Ideal
Group� game.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>His nominations for best drummer included Cosy Powell but he
had forgotten which group he played for and had to ring home for the answer.<span
style='color:red'> .(The answer was just about every group including Deep
Purple, Black Sabbath, Rainbow, Whitesnake etc.)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:red'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The good thing about the curry house was that it was next to
the hotel. The food was simple and the choice of naans was limited, despite
Stubbees requests.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There was still a great thirst despite all the beer and wine
to require a final visit to Pier 40. The customers and the television show were
just as weird but the beer was good.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Most left before the bewitching hour of 1:00 am before the
Hotel Krone doors were to be locked though Sid and Keithee stayed for a few
more and had to beg a late entrance.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Accounts were settled with reductions for the cold showers
and the Squarrites made their way to the ferry over to <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Switzerland</st1:place></st1:country-region> where
Keithee expected everyone to speak Swiss.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The train to <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Zurich</st1:place></st1:City>
was waiting with seats available on the upper deck.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Airport duty frees were purchased before heading for drinks.
The bar had obviously been designed for waitress service, with the tills on the
customer side and the beer taps on the other. The waitress finished serving and
then made her way round to the till by which time she had forgotten what she
had served and to whom<span style='color:red'>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The flight home was delayed by 30 minutes but the journey
was uneventful.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Roseville</st1:City></st1:place>�s
mini bus turned up within minutes and the driver sped off towards the motorway
before a sharp turn to Wilmslow.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>�It�s Chocka!� he exclaimed. �The M6 is total chocka.�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Keiths made a hurried revision to their plans to get
home as the bus followed the A34 southwards.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Keithee and Jacko made a quick exit in Congleton to wave
goodbye to another great adventure.</p>
