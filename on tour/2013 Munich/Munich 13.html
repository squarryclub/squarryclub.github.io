through the wash in the pocket of some particularly dark trousers that had 
reduced the notes to the grim reapers calling cards. The notes, except the 5

<td colspan="4">The Squarrites reassembled in the lobby for more 
beer before a split, with some to cross the road to the pizza restaurant where 
Yup ordered his favourite calzone.
<p>Scottee insisted that a 70 cl. bottle of wine at 22 Euros was better value 
than a 1/3rd glass of house red at 4 Euros. He finally conceded but claimed that 
wine by the glass would taste like vinegar.</p>
<p>He went for a glass of the superior Chianti and declared it so good he took 
forever to finish it.</p>
<p>Yup, Zoe and Brian returned to the Hotel while the others went off to join 
Sid, Graham and Keithee at the Shakespeare.</p>
<p>The party was in full swing again though Sid claimed his wife had packed the 
wrong air guitar. He nodded to a sleeping Keithee in the corner. �It�s nice to 
see the old folk enjoying themselves�.</p>
<p>Graham enquired at the bar and was directed to a cloakroom from where he 
returned with Keithee's jacket and placed it on his lap as he slept.</p>
<p>The music was loud and disco and must have annoyed those living close to the 
open fronted bar. The rendition of Alice (Who the X is Alice) was particularly 
well accompanied and very loud</p>
<p>The route back to bed was completed without further creative street art.<p>Scottee and Richie woke in the middle of the night to another apparition in 
their room. This time it was Graham begging to be allowed to stay in order to 
avoid Keithee�s snoring.<p>&nbsp;</td>

<td colspan="4"><b>Saturday 5th October</b><p>Bill and Jacko lay in their beds 
assuming that the other had set an alarm and was aware of the time. The peace 
was broken by a call from Zoe to say that the Squarrites were leaving for the 
Station to catch the train to Fussen.</p>
<p>10 minutes later they had joined a waiting Sid for the dash while Yup 
negotiated a special group ticket.</p>
<p>Sid read the timetable and spotted that the Fussen train was to leave from 
track 31 and scoured the train in search of the others. </p>
<p>With minutes to spare Yup arrived with the group ticket which included return 
rail and bus travel all the way to Neuschwanstein for a bargain cost of 8 Euros 
each.</p>
<p>The train took off at speed through the suburbs and a girl passed down the 
carriage to conduct a survey. �Does anyone on the train speak German?� she 
pleaded to a sea of blank faces.</p>
<p>The track quality deteriorated and the train slowed so that the journey took 
2 hours to reach Fussen. The connecting bus was just leaving but stopped to 
allow the Squarrites to board. All seats on the bus had been taken but it was 
worth standing rather than to repeat the 2 mile boring walk taken in 2003.</p>
<p>The cattle pens at the ticket hall were packed and 
overflowing. The earliest tour of the Castle interior would be 4:15 so that the 
last train back to Munich would be missed.</p></td>

<td colspan="4"><p>The decision was taken to walk to 
the Castle and explore the grounds.</p>
<p>Graham looked up to the height of the mountain and considered his condition.</p>
<p>�I�ll make my own way back to Munich� he declared.</p>
<p>His new best mate, Keithee, elected to stay with him while the remainder went 
ahead. The golden leaves were falling and the air was heavy with the smell of 
horseshit as the group made the long walk to the first refreshment stop. An 
intake of liquid and a bratworst for some was needed before the tour of the 
Castle courtyard and perimeter.</td>

<p>The journey to the bridge over the ravine was completed but the loose decking 
boards and sheer weight of gawping viewers put most off crossing to the far 
side.</p>
<p>The short cut down soon reached Keithee and a slightly improved Graham.</p>
<p>The bus back to Fussen was thought to run every 10 minutes but an inspection of 
the timetable suggested an interval of 1 hour as the rain began to fall even 
heavier.</p>
<p>The bus arrived and an assessment of the capacity and the length of queue 
confirmed the worst view. The driver continued to accept boarders as the queue 
shuffled forward. With every corner of the bus filled and the Squarrites almost 
there, the door slammed shut and the bus left.</p>
<p>The rain increased again and looked set to continue for the duration of the 1 
hour wait.</p>
<p>�At least I don�t have to worry about the rain specks on my glasses� said 
Keithee.</p>
<p>Just as despondency descended another bus with an extended route number arrived 
to allow the Squarrites to escape the rain and sit and smile at the saturated 
Chinese as they boarded.</p>
