OCTOBER 2009<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>The Squarrites
gathered as usual at Westbury Tavern with time enough to spare for Craig to
make his journey from home twice over.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>Keithee was well
prepared and organised with all his Euro notes and coins in left pockets,
sterling in his right and jewels in the middle. Jacko, as usual, was bewildered
by his 9 separate pockets and resorted to panic attacks at each search.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>Utterly, the new Squarrite,
arrived 20 minutes late.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>Bolt noted that
the <st1:City w:st="on">Munich</st1:City> beer festival was on at the same time
as <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Stuttgart</st1:place></st1:City>.
�Sounds like <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Germany</st1:place></st1:country-region>
is one great p*** up at this time of year.� he added.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>Keithee was
looking forward to meeting the serving girls again with their big jugs and
phenomenal wrist action.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>Axe announced that
he would be too busy to join the group in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">London</st1:place></st1:City>
and commiserated with the cab drivers in advance.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>Check in at <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Birmingham</st1:place></st1:City>, after a quick
detour through the wrong terminal, was easy though the flight was delayed until
17:15 prompting Sid to comment that if we were 633 Squadron we would be there,
dam broke and back before departure time.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>Yup replied that
he had already dumped his load.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>Three booking
references had been supplied but Yup�s �BW2 JOB� looked suspiciously like a
badly texted request for in-flight fellatio.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>Take off time was
extended until 17:45 though the Bulgarian barman kept us amused with his
observations about all the bloody foreigners spoiling <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Britain</st1:place></st1:country-region> and
adding to the security scares.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>Yup asked �What is
the difference between a terrorist and a woman?� to which the answer was �You
can negotiate with a terrorist.�<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>The plane to <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Stuttgart</st1:place></st1:City> was a 2 each
side German built model but with low key English crew and cabin staff.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><st1:City w:st="on"><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>Stuttgart</span></st1:City><span
style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'> airport appeared ghostly empty but train
fares all the way to <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Heidelberg</st1:place></st1:City>
could be bought via a machine at 60 Euros each or 34 Euros each for groups of
5.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>Transfer to <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Stuttgart</st1:place></st1:City> was available
by early but slow train or the direct but later train that Yup elected to use.
Several trains were rejected until the cry went up �The Yup says Yes�<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>There was only
time for toilets and pizzas before the train to <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Heidelberg</st1:place></st1:City> left from platform 6 at 22:31.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>The train was a
disaster by German standards (DIN?) and left several minutes late but was super
smooth interrupted only by the automatic door that slid open every time that
Richie gestured with his arms.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>Arrival at <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Heidelberg</st1:place></st1:City> was a lonely
experience with a deserted station and Yup had to navigate by dead reckoning.
He was forced to seek directions to the Bayrischer Hof at the Chinese takeaway.
Yup�s Chinese proved better than the Oriental�s English and the Squarrites set
off on the long trek to the Hotel.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>Craig started to
regret the lack of wheels to his suitcase after the first mile but continued
with only moderate moaning until we met the local bag lady.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>He was convinced
that she was either mad or sinister as she directed the group to various
locations and expensive Hotels until we arrived at the correct site.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>However the
Bayrischer Hof proved to be locked and bolted with a sign directing latecomers
to the Kebab shop for the entrance key.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>The door was
opened to reveal a counter laden with keys to rooms and to the street door.
Suitcases were quickly dumped and out to the Gecko Caf� for nightcaps taken
from crinkled glasses.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>Our delayed
arrival could have proved disastrous for the Kebab shop was shut and the first
night in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Heidelberg</st1:place></st1:City>
could have been spent camping on the pavement.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span
style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>Friday 25<sup>th</sup> September<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>Breakfast was good
though the toaster was slow and the bacon supply even slower.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>Formal check in
procedure was completed and out to the old town centre for the first drink of
the day.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>Stubbie recalled
his youth with stories of the free spirits of the vicar�s daughters abandoning
their underwear. �Yes, I think I�ve heard of Nicholas Parson�s daughter� noted
Jacko. Bill commented on the quality and size of the conkers he had collected
to take home though he still had some in the suitcase he had taken to <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Bucharest</st1:place></st1:City> a year earlier.
�William the conkerer noted Stubbie.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>The funicular line
station lay beside the Castle (Schloss) at the eastern end of the old town with
return tickets priced at 18 Euros. Keithie was convinced that there were
footpaths and the climb would be good.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>However the
familiar cry of �The Yup says yes� was heard and the train was boarded to the
first stop at the Castle. A brief discussion of travel arrangements took place
until a new cry of �The Yup says NO� echoed out.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>The change over
from new to old trains was made and the long slow journey to the mountain top
completed with Keithee less sure of his call for exercise.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>The sun shone
brightly, the beer was good and the scenery required many photos to be taken.
Keithee commented that a woman was like a camera � a box with a hole. Press
some buttons and see what develops.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>A large, hairy
caterpillar tempted Jacko to make a close inspection. �Mind he doesn�t bite
shouted Dasher. �I assume you are calling to the caterpillar� added Keithee.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>A wasp appeared in
Bolt�s beer. Many solutions to remove the offending insect were put forward
including Richie�s offer to top up to the rim with his own beer.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>Keithee offered to
whip it out with his bell-end.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>A simple
precaution of transferring the beer mat from under to over the pot was
generally adopted.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>�Are we having
another?� asked Yup to which the general reply was �Yes, but no wasp in mine
please�<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>Dasher arrived
with a large plate of chips with mayo and tomato dips. �Nice to have something
with your beer� he said. �Yes, like another pint maybe� replied Keithee.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>More beers at 18
Euros for 5 were ordered.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>The journey back
was made via a visit to the small museum with exhibits that included a waxwork
dummy in tram driver�s uniform that reminded Bolt of the SS.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>The stop at the
Castle was worthwhile and star attractions included the world�s largest barrel and
the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">National</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceName
 w:st="on">Apothecary</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Museum</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>The round tower
had been sheared in half in some bygone time as a result of war, earthquake or
jerry building. We perhaps should have bought a guide book or joined a tour.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>The view over the
River Neckar was magnificent. The navigation locks impressed Dasher. �Look at
the size of the barges� he said. �Onion Bargees?� enquired Yup.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>�You need some
serious therapy� said Dasher.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>It was by now
later than 3 o�clock and most of the eateries had closed leaving little choice.
Half went to Pizza Hut and the remainder to the Irish bar. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>Re-united at the
bar the conversation turned to football.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>Sid commented that
Uttoxeter was midway between Stoke and <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Derby</st1:place></st1:City>
so that the town was therefore split between the two teams. �<st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City
 w:st="on">Derby</st1:City></st1:place> were called rams for what they did to
sheep and that can�t be right can it?� �Indeed <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Derby</st1:place></st1:City> supporters had discussed the best way
to do it and had recommended first throwing the animal on its back. How else
can you kiss them they had concluded. He was surprised to note that everyone
winced at kissing but without reaction to shaxxing!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>There was more
talk of football in the gents where the urinal bowl included a small goal and
ball on a spring. With a good eye and a little concentration it was possible to
score into triple figures at one visit.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>The Irish barman
recommended a pub in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Stuttgart</st1:place></st1:City>
called Biddy Early�s in order to watch the big match between Stoke and M.U. on
big screen T.V. His mate, Abdul, could take us in two mini buses to <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Stuttgart</st1:place></st1:City> at a cost of 40
Euros each. The cost was similar to the train but avoided the long walk to the
station and the consequent need to get the suitcase wheels re-treaded.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>The way back to
the Hotel was made via the old Bridge followed by the steep climb to the
Philosopher�s Walk to admire the views.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>Yup made a brief
stop at the Indian Restaurant by the river to reserve a table for 13 diners.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>A few more beers
followed by a quick power nap was all that was needed to prepare for a night on
the old town starting off at the Gecko Bar at 7:30 where Craig had difficulty
mounting a high stool. �Like watching a walrus getting onto a bicycle� noted
Keithee.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>Off through the
old town stopping only for a quick photo opportunity at Kunst Passage which was
big enough to take all. There turned out to be many similarly named locations
in the town but, as Stubbie pointed out, �You�ve seen one you�ve seen them all�<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>Yup led the way to
the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Indian</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType
 w:st="on">Palace</st1:PlaceType></st1:place> and confirmed that it seemed up
to Squarry standard. A table was booked for later but left him with the problem
of cancelling the first Indian. For the next hour he tried every combination of
prefixes to contact them until the waitress in the Irish bar showed him how to
use his fingers successfully.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>The <st1:place
w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Indian</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Palace</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>
was empty and filled Yup with foreboding. His concerns were raised even higher
when the waiter announced that he had no poppadoms or Peshwari naans. Keithee
suspected that the place was just a front for a money laundering outfit involving
sex, drugs and white slavery.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>The waiter
consulted someone by telephone as if to relay the food order to the fast food
greasy spoon place around the corner.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>Confidence and
comfort was regained when the Stoke tradition of turning the plates over
revealed that they were Steelite.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>Graig claimed the
first meal presented and was almost finished before he realised that he had
actually ordered the meal that the waiter was trying to force on Yup.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>Poor Yup had to
wait while the tandoori was fired up again to prepare the meal he had set his
heart on.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>Dasher reported
that he was looking forward to a good nights sleep after being disturbed the
night before by the trams that had knocked on the window to ask Keithee to be
quiet.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>The night was
finished at the Gecko bar with a few beers in the now familiar crinkled glasses
followed by a few rounds of flaming sambukas.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span
style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>Saturday 26<sup>th</sup> September<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>The day began with
a stroll through the old town to the tune of an um-pah band and a display of
synchronised clapping and stamping by a group of South African schoolgirls. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>The opportunity
was taken for a quick trip up the glass lift for last minute photos, Hotel
bills were settled and Abdul arrived for the transfer.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>In the taxi
Stubbie declined to wear a seat belt claiming that, since he was sitting back
to front, the worst that could happen in a crash was that he would end up
kissing Jacko opposite him. Keithee commented that death would be preferable.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>Yup enquired about
the deeper meaning of Beatles music and the hidden references to hard drugs. He
was surprised to learn that Hey Jude had been written to Julian Lennon
imploring him to consider masturbation as comfort during the break up of his
parent�s marriage.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>They don�t write
songs like that anymore.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>The driver had the
attention span of a butterfly and constantly toggled from radio to CD and from
track to track. He was so busy driving the music system that he forgot to drive
the bus.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>The Arcotel Camino
Hotel was modern but appeared to have been founded on older, grander and
perhaps more sinister foundations. The reception desk was full of efficient and
helpful staff with a command of English that surpassed that of the Idle
Burgers.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>The rooms were
stark but roomy and complete with wardrobes carefully disguised as mini bars.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>We made our way to
Biddy Early�s and Sid set up a book for the result while Richie and Tatee
elected for more sightseeing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>Dinkel Acker beers
all round were ordered though Dasher settled for Guinness with a dash of
blackcurrant.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>The match appeared
lack lustre though Utterly got passionate at regular intervals and called for a
penalty every time Stoke lost the ball. Cheese and ham toasties (with crisps)
at 3.90 Euros helped to pass the time before Stubbie won the jackpot with his
forecast of 2:0 to M.U.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>The Idle Burgers
made a confident return through the underground maze that doubled as a shopping
mall and railway station to the Hotel for showers. Dasher went one better and
donned his trunks to search for the swimming pool that had been promised by
Richie. Keithee joined him in the lift down but left in disappointment while
Dasher enjoyed the delights of the �wet room�. The only way out of the basement
was by lift but, because Keithee had taken the key, Dasher (minus his wet
trunks) was only able to travel to the ground floor. The lift door opened to
reveal an embarrassed Dasher to the masses assembled in the lobby and refused
to shut thereafter. Dasher was forced to smile and mutter Gutten Tag as he
gripped his towel closer to climb the stairs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>Yup eased his
embarrassment by taking his photo.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>The search for a
suitable restaurant led past the gay bar to the upstairs room at the Castatte
zum Paulander. The delightful waitress positively zinged with energy. Bolt
admitted he was �smitten�.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>The fabulous main
courses were followed by apple strudel and ice cream and more beer.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>The two separate
bills were settled separately.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>The night was
still young but cold was descending as the Idle Burgers settled in for drinks
at the banjo bar in easy chairs set in the pedestrianised street.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>Red blankets were
accepted by Axe and Craig to be wrapped round their shoulders for warmth. Axe
commented that it was all good preparation for the geriatric ward. All that was
missing was that comforting smell of stale urine.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>Sid observed that
it was all downhill from now to which Yup replied that he would be grateful for
a change from all the uphills.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>Sunday 27<sup>th</sup> September<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>The Hotel had been
booked without breakfasts so the Idle Burgers gathered in the underground mall
to grab sandwiches and coffee while some settled for a sausage and cheese
concoction that looked good but lost much when served stone cold.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>Craig was last to
finish prompting Richie to comment that the concept of fast food to go had not
been grasped by Craig.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>Group train
tickets were available with generous discounts so that it was cheaper to buy a
ticket for 5 than for 2 separate tickets.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>The journey to
Cannstatter Wasen was interesting being part underground, part slow tram and
part main line and took us past the open air lido direct to the park.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>The Idle Burgers
split into two groups- one to visit the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName
 w:st="on">Mercedes</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Benz</st1:PlaceName>
 <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Museum</st1:PlaceType></st1:place> and one to reserve
a table at the preferred beer tent.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>The Grand Parade
was a mixture of brewery drays pulled by up to 8 horses and interspersed with
decorated wheelbarrows. One particular carriage loaded with dignitaries and
pulled by a proudly trotting horse attracted attention. �That will be the
Mayor�s Mare�, said Stubbie.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>Yup decided on the
Hof Brau tent and enquired about reservations. Entry to the tents in <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Munich</st1:place></st1:City> had been by
advance ticket only and Yup was surprised to learn that we could sit at any
unreserved table. He led the way to Table 212 and a hard days drinking
commenced. Half chickens with chips helped to ease a few more heavy steins of
beer until the remaining Idle Burgers returned.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>
Dasher quickly
caught the mood and was dancing on the benches before his refreshment arrived.
Sid disappeared and was spotted in various locations around the vast tent
dancing on the table with a world of total strangers.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>A pretty Thai girl
(suspected by some to be a lady-boy) weaved her way through the merry throng to
offer breathalyser test for a charge of 2 Euros. The machine produced random,
meaningless values and was clearly a good money maker. Her even prettier
colleague did an even brisker business.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>The toilets were a
disappointment compared to the merry-go-round milking parlours at <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Munich</st1:place></st1:City>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>We were joined at
various times by strangers who were either lost or had lost it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>Richie treated
himself to a cigar that was seen being enjoyed by various committed
anti-smokers as the Miss Stuttgart competition passed them by.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>The auditions for
ZZ Top turned out to be a �man with most boring beard� competition.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>The time passed
quickly in a giant haze of loud music, walkabouts, danceabouts and drinking
until the music stopped and everyone walked out in an orderly fashion.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>With typical
Teutonic efficiency the train was waiting to take the revellers away.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>The train was
beyond packed and the background noise nearly drowned the hoarse rendition of
Delilah. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>Axe returned to
the Hotel bar and paid 50 Euros for 4 brandies. On hearing that he had a big
bill Keithee corrected that big Bill had been with him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span
style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>Monday 28<sup>th</sup> September<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>The events of the
previous night were reviewed with blurred recollections.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>Keithee had walked
into a mirror and had apologised profusely to his image before realising his
error.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>Richie had woken
to find his underpants were back to front. He was certain that he had worn them
correctly the evening before and suspected that some pervert had had his evil
way with him in the night and clumsily dressed him on completion.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>The <st1:place
w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Mercedes</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType
 w:st="on">Museum</st1:PlaceType></st1:place> had impressed so much that Dasher
set off to see the Porche site while those who had missed the Sunday visit
retraced their steps.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>However both site
turned out to be closed each and every Monday.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>We were lucky to all
meet again in the main square for beers and pizza while we watched the world go
by. A glass structure within the classical buildings of the Square give access
to a lift to the underground but appeared not out of place.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>We returned to the
Hotel to collect the luggage from the store and Utterly was surprised to learn
that the room cleaner had found his shoes in the wardrobe. Richie was even more
surprised to learn that she had also found his jacket with his house keys in
the pocket. Both blamed the other for the error.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>The trip back to
the airport was uneventful though we were soon aware that the return flight was
delayed. The check in guy had some cock and bull story to claim that the delays
to the inward flight 4 days earlier were still affecting the schedule.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>A big mac type
meal and several rounds of I spy and other Richie originated games helped to
pass the time until we were called to the transit lounge.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>Bill was first to
set off the metal detector alarm and when Jacko followed suit the heavy hand of
German authority came down. The offending item turned out to be the metal
spiral binding to his reporters notebook lost deep in a trouser pocket.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>After such a long
and thorough body the grim faced security heavy triumphantly paraded the book
to prove his prowess to his colleagues who sneered at Jacko in disgust.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>He was lucky not
to have the book confiscated.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>The return flight was
made in a small propeller driven German built plane. The English Captain
explained that the intended plane had broken down and had had to be replaced
with one from <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Edinburgh</st1:place></st1:City>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>The flight was
slower but comfortable with good leg room.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>The taxi arrived
on cue as Axe and Sid went their separate ways.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>Another perfect
end to another well organised Squarry outing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
