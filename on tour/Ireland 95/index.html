<img border="0" src="https://squarryclub.github.io/on tour/Ireland 95/photos/File0098.jpg" width="386" height="254" align="right">We arrived at 
13:35 on Friday 29<sup>th</sup> September at Cork airport courtesy of Maersk Air 
and were met by our personal custodian Pete, driver of our luxury mini coach. We 
were chauffeured via a couple of Guinness watering holes to our digs at Ardmore 
House, where we were met by our hosts Toni &amp; Tom Connor. Complimentary tea &amp; 
cake was quickly consumed. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">The first day's 
walk was from the Windy Gap through Derrycunhilly woods over the Gap of Dunlow 
to Kate Karney's Cottage; a distance of 17 Irish miles or kilometres but who
<img border="0" src="https://squarryclub.github.io/on tour/Ireland 95/photos/File0101.jpg" width="359" height="242" align="left">cares. &nbsp;A visit to the local pubs in Kenmare and a meal passed the rest of the 
evening apart from Crustee moaning that we had stayed too far out of the town 
centre.&nbsp; It must have been at least 800 metres (or 5 minute walk).</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">The second day was 
the big one. &nbsp;A walk over the Coomloura horseshoe taking in three of Irelands 
highest peaks; Caher, Carrantouhill (highest in Ireland) and Beenkeragh. </span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">Our taxi driver 
Pete was so impressed that �dinglish� had come all this way to climb a bit of a 
hill in his back yard that he decided to come with us to see what all the fuss 
was about. &nbsp;The magnificent coach that had picked us up the day before had 
miraculously transformed into a beat 
up old Ford Transit van with wooden slat seats and a window that would not close 
. &nbsp;Pete called at his home to get his plimsoles, wifes 
pink anorak, a packed lunch and a packet of 20 woodies to 
accompany us on the climb.&nbsp; After keeping us 
waiting for 35 minutes (probably having his breakfast) he came out raring to 
go.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">We could see the 
top of Caher from the start of the climb and 3hours later we could still see it 
just as far away.&nbsp; After a relentless uphill climb we arrived at the summit to 
find Pete unhindered by rucksacks, climbing boots etc having his spam butties 
and a woody. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;<img border="0" src="https://squarryclub.github.io/on tour/Ireland 95/photos/Carantoohil jc and me.jpg" width="423" height="289" align="right"></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">Pete, Tim Brackers 
and Simon completed the route around the rest of the 
horseshoe over Carranntouhill and Beenkeragh while the rest of us decided to 
return the way we came. &nbsp;The wind was so strong, at least 2mph, that it blew Joe 
over. Yuppy screamed �don�t move� and ran to take a photo of Joe in his 
distressed state. Eventually Joe was helped to his feet by Jaycee and the decent 
continued. A few hundred metres from the base of the mountain we crossed paths 
with a large white bull. &nbsp;Joe 
thought he�d seen a banshee and decided to take a detour half way 
back up the mountain to allow Yuppy�s red socks to distract the bull. &nbsp;The bull 
took no notice of the socks or Yuppy and Jaycee jumping a ravine as wide as 
Beechers Brook, meanwhile Joe who climbed 1500m in record time 
arrived half an hour later after his �short� detour.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">It was about an 
inch on the map from the start of the walk to the Climbers Inn at Glencar but it 
took forever to walk. &nbsp;Jaycee was like Bambi on ice because his legs were so 
weak. Just as the Climbers Inn came into sight we were 
overtaken by the stragglers in the van to beat us to the pub.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">Much Guinness was 
consumed in the pub and somehow Jaycee lost his trousers. As the Inn was a 
Church in sheep�s clothing, we prayed for some traditional Irish music and as if 
a miracle had occurred A young lad appeared with a guitar and began playing and 
singing.&nbsp; Crustee  
suggested we should go with him to the local pub in Killorglin where he was 
doing a turn that night. &nbsp;We asked Pete what he thought and he said �I don�t 
give a shite�, so off we went.&nbsp; The first pub that we entered was painted black 
and had a tricolour fastened to the ceiling.&nbsp; Crustee�s trousers turned brown and 
a strange odour filled the air, so after downing one pint we left.&nbsp; The second 
pub was packed, chatter and laughter was loud.&nbsp; As we entered a deathly silence 
ensued. Who are these strangers entering our pub?&nbsp; Alright lads bellowed from a 
corner, it was our young lad.&nbsp; Suddenly we were flavour of the month and 
normality resumed. Events now become hazy but there is photographic evidence to 
show all of us having a dance with the locals to the resident Irish dance band (Crustee bribed the leader). &nbsp;After this apparently we all hung upside 
down like chickens in a butcher�s window on the car park barrier outside or so 
the photograph shows anyway. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">Pete (driver) had 
so much Guinness (at least 10 pints) he could not remember the way back to the B 
and B in Kenmare so he decided to drive over the mountain pass to avoid the 
Garda in Killarney. &nbsp;As the transit van could not get over the Ballebema pass 
with all the weight, we all got out to discharge a substantial amount of 
processed Guinness. &nbsp;All except for Yuppy who was not aware the van had even 
stopped. He did not dare open his mouth and ask a question or he would have 
vomited all over Jaycee.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">We arrived back at 
the digs about 4a.m. and Yuppy hit the bed fully clothed and did not move until 
he smelt the bacon and eggs cooking for breakfast.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">Pete apparently 
none the worse from the previous night picked us up  
to return to Cork Airport and back to England.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">We were all in the 
van waiting for Brackers who�s always late but well organised, so we thought.&nbsp; It 
was only when we got to the airport that he realised that he had left a clock 
that he had bought for a present on the bed.&nbsp; &quot;Perhaps they will post it&quot; he said, 
fat chance.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">We arrived back at 
Birmingham international at 15:45 on Monday 2<sup>nd</sup> October laughing and 
reminiscing all the way home.</span></p>
