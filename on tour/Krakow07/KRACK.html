spare but found only one house displaying a number. Curtains twitched and
fingers reached out to dial 999 as Keithee ventured to make closer inspections.
A quick call to Stubbee resulted in directions to <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName
 w:st="on">Stubbee</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Towers</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>,
park up and rendezvous at the Tavern. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>Richie arrived in
a dodgy rainmac and covered in sweat, blamed on a fast walk all the way from
Penkhull to board the bus to meet up with the independent Chris at <st1:place

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>There was much
discussion about the 15kg. weight allowances with Steve having to unload part
of his Hi-Vis suitcase into Jacko’s<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>case. A better policy of combining the weight of the passenger and
luggage to produce a weight limit was proposed and promoted a mass visit to the
scales. Most of the Squarry Club appeared to be fully metricated with an
average of 100kg. each, though Bill weighed in at 128.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>Bill was selected
for special treatment and the rest made our usual rear entry onto the plane in
the safe knowledge, as Keithee pointed out, that no plane had ever backed into
a mountain.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>Arrival at <st1:place

labelled “No. 1” with something of a lucky dip result.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>A labrador was
brought through the crowd to sniff at everyone’s crutch and baggage. “Nice
doggie” says Richie to prompt the handler to take Chris to the interview room.
He was excused the full body search but did confess to smoking a weed called Silk
Cut.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>Yup lead the way
to the first bar of the evening. The Fischer Pub had been renamed Od Nova and was
a simple cellar bar hosted by Magda who was kept busy mopping up the spilt
beer.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Keithee requested Pink Floyd to be
played but got Toto instead. She’d even confuse them with Tonto and the Lone

been set for 6:30 with breakfast at 7:00 in order to catch the bus at 8:15. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>Our driver Bert
turned out to be an ex honorary Stokee having spent some time working for
Pointon’s of Cheddleton. <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>He recalled
that on one occasion the smell of his load was so awful that the police had
been called to escort him out of <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Birmingham</st1:place></st1:City>.
We talked of cultural differences and learnt that 3 Wright’s pies on top of
each other was known as a Bentilee wedding cake.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>Richie commented
on the state of the buildings that we passed and compared them with <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Cairo</st1:place></st1:City> that he had
recently visited. Yes, those pyramids haven’t had a lick of paint for years
noted Chris.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>We called at a
filling station to be greeted by a very friendly but obviously flea ridden dog.
He soon cleared wide spaces in his search for someone to pat him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>We all bought
water to compensate for the excesses of the previous night but Richie went one
better and purchased a litre of isotonic power drink.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>We joined a group
for the film preview at the <st1:place w:st="on">Auschwitz</st1:place> visitor
centre and watched in silence before following our guide through the “Work will
make you free” gate.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The huge collection
of pitiful possessions was moving, though crumpled photos of individual
children lost in “The Final Solution” were even more heartbreaking.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>We agreed with the
guide that it was important to witness the site but felt guilty for finding it
fascinating.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Auschwitz II Birkenau
proved even more poignant.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We walked the
vast extent of the site to the memorial on the site of the chambers to arrive
just in time for a sudden downpour. It seemed a significant place to experience
a shower.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>Lunch was obtained
at Artur’s on the way back.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Chris
declared that bacon, eggs &amp; chips were always the same and you couldn’t go
wrong. It arrived as a yellow mass with lumps.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>As always, Bill’s meal looked the best though he wasn’t sure whether it
was pork, beef or whatever.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Richie’s
“noodles” arrived as jumbo ravioli dumplings but received great approval.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>Bert was asked
where the Indian Restaurant was and looked horrified at the prospect of transporting
8 gaseous passengers exuding the results of the previous night’s curry. <span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>“Just like driving for Pointon’s” he was
reminded.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>We made our way
back to <st1:place w:st="on">Krakow</st1:place> to the sounds of classical
music played as Irish jigs. We left Bert to his music as we exited on the far
side of the town so as to save him a long return journey through the rush hour
jams.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>After a quick
shower and in need of some light hearted refreshment we made our way to the
basement lounge of the Cat’s Bollocks bar.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The music was loud and appeared to make Bill’s ears glow in the dark
while Richie sipped a frozen Daiquiris Pink Panther. He described it as a pink
pussy only larger.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The local girls
played electronic darts on a flashing board. Removal of the darts proved more
interesting than the game itself but then Jocky Wilson never wore a thong.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The quest for the perfect cocktail began and
Steve lost his cherry (as well as his umbrella) with a dubious Hawaiian. Jacko
ordered a Kamikaze Extreme comprising Vodka, Curacao &amp; Zyklon B that
arrived as 8 flaming drinks on a small tray.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>He was too mean to lose so much to evaporation and blew out the flames
and drank the tray.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>The Curry House
was small and shared a loo with a dubious nightclub in the adjacent arcade. We
crammed on one table for a stodgy, powdery cuisine that was distinctly lacking
any Eastern delight. <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Many more drinks
were needed to compensate.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span
style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>Saturday 29<sup>th </sup>Zakopane <o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>Assembling all 8
at the same time proved difficult with disappearances for extra clothing after
mention of snow in the mountains.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Jacko
&amp; Richie were first on the bus and sat in the hot seats by the window to
fry in the fierce glare of the sun.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We
made a toilet stop in the foothills and viewed the local handicrafts of goat’s
cheese and the curing pelts of several ex-animals. The bear skin turned out to
be the pelt of a wild boar but was no less fearsome and definitely not the kind
of thing to take home as a souvenir.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>The ski lift at
Zakopane was undergoing its annual overhaul so Bert led the way through the
market by the riverside and on to the funicular rail terminus for the trip to
the ridge. He appeared to jump the queue to purchase the return tickets and
thoughts of a return on foot through deep snow disappeared.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The mountain ridge gave views over the town
towards the Tatra mountain ski slopes and was filled with locals who appeared
already high on something other than fresh air. We joined them with a glass or
two on a boarded veranda to watch the world go by until Bert signalled it was
time for lunch at his much recommended café.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>Jacko heard
mention of donkey kebabs, rat burgers and pig’s kneecaps but settled for the
set menu of hot soup served in an un-carriable bowl, followed by pork with
lashings of cold fermented cabbage.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The toilet
had its own mysteries and exhibits and was definitely not worth the entrance
cost.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We made our first visit to the
pedestrianised main street of Zakopane and were surprised to find that the
soprano voice of the busker belonged to a man.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>He seemed to sing “No one knows that I have farted” in an effortless
switch from tenor to castrato without adjusting his trousers.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>Bert inquired
about the thermal baths but was directed to the municipal <st1:place w:st="on">Lido</st1:place>
and on to a Hotel but no luxury swimming was on offer. We had to settle for a
visit to the ski jump and a toilet stop in the adjacent all-wooden chalet
before returning to the town for more beers in the company of the local
revellers who were by now even more joyful.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The return journey was uneventful and Steve suggested that Bert drop us
off so that we could take a walking short cut through the Shopping Mall.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>A bar in a
courtyard with seating in the open, within a well furnished gazebo served B52’s
with Bailey’s poured immaculately over a cranked spoon over a layer of Cointreau
and <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Kailua</st1:place></st1:City> to
make a perfect mini Guinness.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Richie
produced a flame to add a hot topping but soon had it licked.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Bill returned with a tray of drinks but had
“lost his cool” and had to return to the bar to ask the barman what each glass
contained. A half buried boat lay in the courtyard and we speculated how it had
arrived.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>‘I had been giving it some
thought and then it just sank in’ said Stubee. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>The diners at the
Italian Restaurant deep in the basement of a cheap hotel included a group of
jolly Brummies and Steve soon had them engaged in <st1:place w:st="on">Black
 Country</st1:place> banter.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The chef
was about to end his shift but was persuaded to stay to produce probably the
best meal of our stay in <st1:place w:st="on">Krakow</st1:place>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>Sunday 30<sup>th</sup> Wieliczka Salt Mine
&amp; Shindler’s Factory<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>Our Driver,
Martin, deputised for Bert who was the only qualified Public Service Vehicle
driver with the Company and was required to drive the bus elsewhere.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The journey to the Salt Mine was short and
tickets were soon bought for the trip underground to the tune of “Hi-Ho, Hi-Ho”
via 48 flights of heavy wooden steps within a casing made of tree trunks to
join our guide Kara.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The salt bearing
rock appeared more like granite and had been carved into large caverns with
intricate sculptures and detailed reliefs.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The trip back to the surface was thankfully made in a lift cage as we
were counted out to ensure that not even the noisy little brat was left behind.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>Martin took us the
short distance to Shindler’s Factory which was surprisingly still a working
factory making the same enamelled ware and looking very much as the 1940’s
photo. <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>The museum was “closed” on Sunday
but the caretaker was up for a bit of freelance enterprise and opened the doors
whenever money fell into her hand.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>Martin then took a
route through the cemetery to the hilltop overlooking the City and produced 16
cans of various beers with nothing in common but a cheap price and high alcohol
content. <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>The magnificent views started
to blur as we climbed back down to the bus for the trip to the Jewish Quarter.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>The flea market
was packing up as we settled at a bar for more liquid refreshment and to watch
the world go by on His &amp; Hers matching Segways. <span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Yupee appeared from the market café with
cheese &amp; ham open rolls decorated with crisps and elephant’s toenails. <span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>3 more rounds of beers were ordered followed
by 2 rounds of hot shots.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>We made our way
via a further round of flaming Sambukas to the Bombay Tandori Restaurant
proudly displaying an Indonesian sign, though the waitress confirmed that the
chef/owner was a Polish woman with no oriental connection.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Richie decided to invest in the fine art market
of up and coming artists and bought a dubious Van Gogh from a young footballer.
<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>He hoped his footballing skills were
better than his talent with a crayon.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>We returned to the
Od Nova pub where Keithee proudly announced that he was as Pi**** as Fu** and
proceeded to invite two strangers to join him with a “966”.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>“A 96 everybody – trust me”, he announced.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>Bill carried him
home while Ritchie, assisted by Yuppee, alternated between trying to climb
walls and lying down to rest on the pavement.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span
style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>Monday 1<sup>st</sup> October<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>Chris had left the
Pub before the silliness had begun and was surprised to find everyone in
various shades of grey at breakfast.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Keith
recalled the hallucination he had experienced during the night. <span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>He had been a prisoner of the Nazis and made
to stand naked in a corner. <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>He
remembered taking comfort from his faith before descending into a
multi-coloured hell. <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>The experience had
proved very humbling for both Keith and Steve.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>Seeking a quiet
day we ambled through the railway station and compared the old and new
architecture.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The barbican was thronged
with students enjoying the culture as we enjoyed the views.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>A middle aged busker played endless keepee
upee in the pedestrianised street and took rest breaks to continue while lying
down. <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Clearly he wasn’t match fit.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The falsetto strains of “No one knows that
..” filled the air as we realised the castrato had followed us from Zakopane to
sing outside the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceType w:st="on">City</st1:PlaceType>
 <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Church</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>An “official
guide” offered to give us a tour of <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Wavel</st1:PlaceName>
 <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Castle</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>. <span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>He would take us to all the places of interest
that would otherwise be unavailable but his expensive offer was declined. “You
will regret it when you get lost in the vaults” he sneered.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>The Castle turned
out to be shut to all on Mondays but tickets were available to view the Cathedral,
bell tower and tombs.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The bell tower
comprised a wooden lattice of heavy timbers clad in stone and copper.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The route up involved a zigzag scramble
through the claustrophobic gaps of the lattice but was conquered by all
including Bill.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The tombs proved
extensive and equally claustrophobic among the caskets.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>The sun shone over
the wide River Wisla and we marvelled that there was a further 500 miles of
river to the <st1:place w:st="on">Baltic Sea</st1:place>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>Yuppy felt a
little better and risked a 5 zloty sandwich but renewed his nausea at the sight
of the mountain of mayonnaise and donated it to Chris.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Keith thought that he may be up to trying
solids by the evening.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>Chris was up for a
final night fling but was met with little enthusiasm and he had to settle for a
meal at Roosters.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Stubbee recalled that
a pub in <st1:Street w:st="on"><st1:address w:st="on">Liverpool Road</st1:address></st1:Street>
had been so desperate for trade that the landlady had served beer while
topless. <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>She was not a stunner and the
business had failed.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>“Did the drinkers
ask if she could put a top on that?” Keithee asked.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>Tottenham played
Aston Villa on the big TV screens and Yup was unhappy. <span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>The kebab he had eaten earlier after
dismissing the 5 zloty sandwich was in danger of returning.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>His steak tasted risky so he kept to just the
salad of cabbage, red onion and shredded carrot which was considered a safer
bet.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Our waitress, Mirala, continued to
serve in her very practical outfit of red shorts and sheer blouse and the food
appeared to improve.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Steve had a wooden
platter of ribs and pink chicken legs that were so fresh that they were raw. <span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>The pile of debris and bones left on
completion filled the platter more than when it was delivered. <span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Chris was still up for a return to the bar in
the courtyard but no one followed. <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>“Old
Codgers” he muttered. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>Bert arrived his
usual half hour early at 11:00 for the return to the airport.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>At the airport the signs dictated Gate 2 but
we were directed upstairs to Gates 6-12.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Stubee received a total touch up but avoided the rubber glove before
returning downstairs to the Duty Free where Yup was found buying a further 2
bottles of Polish Spirit for 65 zloty. <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>The
return to East Midlands was uneventful as we said goodbye to Chris and Steve
and joined the waiting bus back to <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Westbury</st1:PlaceName>
 <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Park</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
