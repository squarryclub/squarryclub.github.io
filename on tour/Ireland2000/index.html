lads (cars 3 and 4) met at the airport full of excitement and expectation.&nbsp; 
Pedro asked if we were on time.&nbsp; However, despite all the planning and 
preparation, no one could have foreseen the length of the impending delay. The 
flight was delayed, not just 1 hour but around 4-5 hours, half a days drinking 
had been lost.&nbsp; A general fuel shortage had been threatened in England.&nbsp; Joe was 
quick to point out that our delay was probably due to the fact that the Irish 
airline staff didn’t know the difference between petrol and paraffin whereas he 
knew that there was 2 f’s in paraffin and that there was no f in petrol.&nbsp; At 
least refreshment vouchers were issued to keep us going. After a hearty 
breakfast we sat down for a further wait generally chatting and mixing together, 
except for Crustie who sat alone composing lyrics for his next album.&nbsp; Finally 
the flight was called and everyone, well everyone except for Joe and Spike who 
had gone for a walkabout, made there way to the departure gate.&nbsp; At last we were 
on the plane.&nbsp; JC managed to get a seat next to the emergency exit door, with 
plenty of leg room.&nbsp; Gazing to his right he noticed a ‘pratt’ of an engine and 
wished he had kept his eyes on the floor.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Up in the air and Spike began his quest to get a Supersonic 
bang; asking a young wench in the seat in front to ‘choose her weapon’.&nbsp; Failing 
on that one he then pestered the stewardess to bend over while he removed a 
thread of cotton from her skirt which was annoying him.&nbsp; A likely story.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The snacks were distributed and as always Roy began the ‘I 
bet I can eat more yoghurts than you’ challenge, but failed miserably when he 
could only get through two.&nbsp; At least this year he didn’t throw up!&nbsp; Dave C 
began experiencing turbulence, I know the feeling.&nbsp; The de-icer came out in 
Cork, the doors finally opened and we were released.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Collecting the cars was a doddle, or so it should have 
been. A ‘blonde tart’ (as she was later described) pushed in at the collection 
desk attempting to arrange a quick change over.&nbsp; It appeared to upset Spike who 
demanded a plane to take him back home.&nbsp; Graham’s car was registered V…ERE.&nbsp; 
What can you say?</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The wacky races began.&nbsp; Me leading, with Roy Schumacher&nbsp; 
‘chunner chunner’&nbsp; ‘where’s your right foot?’ taking up the rear.&nbsp; A quick pint 
at the Mills Bar at Bally Vourney ensued before meeting up with the rest of the 
ferried lads at Tralee.&nbsp; Continuing towards the Conner Pass, Graham veered to 
avoid mowing down cows and later felt sheepish as he recalled having visited the 
area on 4 previous occasions but still conner remember it.&nbsp; Poor organisation by 
Tim meant we were in 2 separate digs (Joe told me to put that in!).&nbsp; A stroll 
down to the town to the first pub on the front and all was good.</p>
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">
<br clear="all" style="page-break-before: always">
&nbsp;</span><p class="MsoNormal">Pedro was sharing a room with Joe.&nbsp; The fear 
of a fate worse than death, using only the threat of a bag of sugar, kept Joe 
awake all night and gave Pedro the most peaceful night he’d ever had.&nbsp; Only the 
faint distant sound of Keith Phillips snoring back in England could be detected.</p>

the pull up to the cliff edges of the 3 sisters.&nbsp; With the wind whistling 
through Joe’s hair, he felt like a bird.&nbsp; Crustie’s blue muffin receipt took 
flight instead.&nbsp; Pedro kept some 500metres away from the cliff edge, clutching 
and squeezing every boulder and stone he could find for support.&nbsp; It has been 
heard that share prices in the 3 sisters sand and gravel pit company are now 
outperforming the footsie.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">After we’d all had our share of the sisters we strolled 
back through the fairways and greens of the local golf course.&nbsp; The 2 groups 
went their separate ways back to the digs.&nbsp; A quick stop for a pint of black 
gold at Bally Ferriter on the way back saw Spike throwing a paddy over the map.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Drinking was heavy the first evening.&nbsp; Crustie at first 
declined a guinness drinking contest but later modified the challenge to ‘who 
could drink the fastest 8th pint!’.&nbsp; The Kentucky Fried fish shop satisfied our 
hungers.&nbsp; A few la la’s resounded in the bars.&nbsp; Crustie supported a group of 
singers whilst Shaun and Joe later needed support to get back to the digs.&nbsp; <!--[if gte vml 1]><v:shape

<p class="MsoNormal">The crawl back to the digs (which incidentally is always 
only a five minute stroll out of the town) was a nightmare.&nbsp; No street lights, 
the wee scottie dog snapping at JC’s heals, and Spike playing dodgems with the 
traffic, also being supported by Steve and Joe.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Trying not to wake the rest of the house, a bedtime brew 
was made.&nbsp; Pedro heard the giggling and came down to see if Joe was up, he was 
turning into a paddy? ‘A fecking great breakfast’ had been scrawled inside the 
visitor’s book, oh god.&nbsp; An hour later the comment had been disguised and all 
was well!!??&nbsp; It was all too much for Pedro so he took a 5 minute nap.</p>

to clear his head, Spike headed for the beach and took an early morning paddle.&nbsp; 
(ijot).&nbsp; He failed.&nbsp; A short stroll around the town in the hope of catching the 
breakaway group also did little to clear his head.&nbsp; We played a game of ‘spot 
the wreck’ for a short while until driving up to the Conner Pass followed by a 
delightful walk along the Dingle Way with Spike in tow, gradually coming to.&nbsp; An 
old farmer with blackened gums beckoned us to him for the crack before we moved 
on to avoid his ferocious dogs.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="font-weight: normal">We visited at least 2 
pubs.&nbsp; Dick Macs (with the famous names set in the paving outside), and the 
ironmongers in the main street, complete with spontaneous songs from a local 
farmer supported by the bar.&nbsp; There aren’t many pubs you can call into and order 
10 pints of guinness and a packet of screws.&nbsp; We left before we were asked to 
give a song.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">A proposed gentle drive back to the airport was changed 
when a temporary diversion to Blarney Castle was included so that Spike could 
treat his wife.&nbsp; Short of a stone or two, Joe admitted he must have had too much 
guinness as he swore we should have passed a shop he knew en route.&nbsp; A needless 
rush to the airport followed as sadly the flight was delayed yet again.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">After returning to the airport in England, the lads in the 
minibus patiently waited for a few minutes whilst I attempted to exchange a 
bottle of body lotion for my beloved.&nbsp; Not a bad swop!&nbsp; (No I don’t mean it!!)</p>
