<h1><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">Thursday</span></h1>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">Arriving at 
Manchester airport, Keith handed in his bulky walking sticks at the check in 
desk.&nbsp; Not to be outdone, an Irishman in the next queue checked in with a pair 
of stepladders!!&nbsp; Well we were on our way to Ireland.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">Ryanair were spot 
on this year with no hold ups and at a bargain cost of only �61.30 return.&nbsp; 
Delays began however after we had touched down as we attempted to find the cars 
hidden in the multi storey.&nbsp; 2 nissan primeras had been provided through Windsor 
Rahney Ltd.&nbsp; Little did we know that the cars would be so up to date that 
neither had tape players, just cd players.&nbsp; Typical, none of us had got any, 
we�d bought tapes.&nbsp; Just hope we don�t have to listen to Crusties favourite 
radio channels announcing memorials and deaths.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">Crustie opted for 
the automatic model whilst �Schumacher� Tim had to make do with the manual.&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">Going west, 
headlights flashed as the Blueberry truckers caf� came into view and five 
minutes later we were all tucking into truckers breakfasts.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">A break at Athlone 
gave us an opportunity to sample our first pint of guinness.&nbsp; It proved to be 
the best pint of the whole trip, or was it?&nbsp; Keith�s vertigo attacks began as we 
strolled along the river bank (a 2 foot high wall), memories of steve (pedro) 
came flooding back.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">Another stint on 
the road saw Crustie falling asleep at the wheel and then the chunnering began 
complaining that Tim was driving too fast.&nbsp; Another break at Athenry and DC 
achieved retribution for not getting a reduction on a plaque bearing the words 
of the Fields of Athenry by � piddling in the Fields�public house.&nbsp; Time for 
another sample of black stuff.&nbsp; Through a haze of smoke generated by a group of 
13 year old schoolgirls smoking like chimneys, Neil began to regurgitate tv 
commercials, imitating Henri with his veroom&nbsp;&nbsp; veroom outbursts.&nbsp; Perhaps it was 
the Smithicks Xtra with a strength of 17.1% that affected his legs. &nbsp;His 
rhythmic dolphin impressions were amazing.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">On arrival at the 
digs �Tantrum Tim� was eventually offered the single room whilst JC bunked up 
with Crustie; much to everyones relief.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">Joined at last by 
Graham, who had driven down from his relatives up north, and Spike, who had 
biked across, we strolled the 5 minute stroll down the road to the town!!&nbsp; Not a 
lot of choice in town but we began to neck the Guinness again and all was well.&nbsp; 
Helpful as always, my magnetism attracted �token man� who was struggling to get 
his change into the ciggy machine.&nbsp; No food was available so Supercrustie came 
to the rescue by bringing back supermacs and chips from across the road.&nbsp; A 
snippet of authentic traditional music in the background and we were contented.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">Graham wizzed back 
to his own digs which was only 10 miles or so up the road.&nbsp; Although he had been 
booked into our digs he had cancelled it on arrival and booked his own digs 10 
miles up the road!!&nbsp; How anti social.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">Back at the digs 
Crustie began playing �find the nob� in his bedroom that he shared with JC.&nbsp; 
Mmmmh!!</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">Friday&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></h2>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">Neil was adamant 
that he was going to have a veggie breakfast and was duly served up with 2 
sausages, bacon, pork chops and steak.&nbsp; What a hog.&nbsp; The maps came out and a 
boat trip to Inis Mor, the largest of the 3 Aran islands was chosen.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span><img border="0" src="https://squarryclub.github.io/on tour/Ireland2002/photos/image002.jpg" width="168" height="180" align="left"><img border="0" src="https://squarryclub.github.io/on tour/Ireland2002/photos/image004.jpg" width="252" height="172" align="right"></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">On the island 
there were several modes of transport available to get around.&nbsp; A group of nuns, 
kitted out in a mixture of sandals, boots and trainers chose the pony and 
traps.&nbsp; We chose minibuses.&nbsp; And Roy chose pushbikes.&nbsp; 
So with concessions obtained we set off on our bikes.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>

<img border="0" src="https://squarryclub.github.io/on tour/Ireland2002/photos/image006.jpg" width="312" height="210" align="left"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">Neil 
noted the sea life activity on the coastline pointing out a group of swans.&nbsp; 
Crustie duly corrected him, informing him that they were herons.&nbsp; What imbo 
seals.&nbsp; When is a heron not a heron - when it�s a red heron of course. </span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">JC upset local 
lass by insisting that girls were wimps and �That�s why we haven�t got any in 
our party!�</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<img border="0" src="https://squarryclub.github.io/on tour/Ireland2002/photos/image008.jpg" width="180" height="252" align="right"></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">It was pointed out 
that Roy was carrying JC�s rucksack.&nbsp; �Around my little finger� JC gestered.&nbsp;</span><img border="0" src="https://squarryclub.github.io/on tour/Ireland2002/photos/Finger_up.gif" width="54" height="73" align="right"></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;Ahha, 
that�s what it meant! </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">Continuing on we 
parked the bikes and clambered up to the celtic stone fort of Dun Aengus.&nbsp; The 
views were stunning with a cliff 
edge Steve Willis would have died for.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">Racing back down 
the island Neil was caught chatting up a young wench who asked him if it was 
worth seeing.&nbsp; Disappointed she headed off to the highest point on the island 
instead to take in the views.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

29<sup>th</sup>�. Tim�s birthday.&nbsp; Roy and Tim had made headway to an inn and 
guided those trailing behind into the beer garden.&nbsp; 9 pints were in!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><img border="0" src="https://squarryclub.github.io/on tour/Ireland2002/photos/image015.jpg" width="199" height="237" align="right"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">The barman offered 
advice on the horse in the adjacent field.&nbsp; How often does Roy take advice, how 
often does he annoy one??&nbsp; The advice�.�If you piss the horse off then he�ll 
jump the fecking wall.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">Hunky Dorys had to 
make do to stave off the hunger.&nbsp; A visit to the toillette before leaving proved 
a little difficult for DC who had to climb onto a stool to reach the trough!&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<img border="0" src="https://squarryclub.github.io/on tour/Ireland2002/photos/image021.jpg" width="168" height="237" align="left"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">A 
short freewheel took us back to the harbour to return the bikes and a last pint 
or two at Joe Macs</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span><img border="0" src="https://squarryclub.github.io/on tour/Ireland2002/photos/image017.jpg" width="119" height="144" align="right"></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">It had been a 
tiring day for some of us.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">Dtd, ddt, tdd 
??????</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">Out for a meal and 
we were split onto 2 separate tables, a fish table and a meat table.&nbsp; JC phoned 
home to report all was well and arrived late at the restaurant.&nbsp; He thought his 
luck was in when asked if he was looking for a group of men but was eventually 
shown upstairs to where we were sitting.&nbsp; Now, not one to make a mountain out of 
a molehill, but my steak was definitely a minute steak compared to DC�s 6hour 
cow.&nbsp; On the bright side, at least I had vegetables to make up for the 
shortfall, (unlike JC.)</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">The local 
hostelries beckoned again.&nbsp; Roy�s knee was giving him some jip so he perched 
himself on a stool, much to the annoyance of a local lass who muttered that she 
hated ignorant men.&nbsp; Keith cleared the pub with his wind instrument, (Not for 
the first time!).</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">Graham appeared 
more relaxed than usual following his recent days of over indulgence in whisky 
and beer!&nbsp; demanding more beer and less talking.&nbsp; Smile and duck became the 
favourite items on the menu as �perv� Graham clicked away on his brownie. Ten 
copies please Graham.&nbsp; He also happened to mention that Dave C wasn�t his usual 
bullish self, what did he mean??</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">At 10 to 12 
Crustie�s knee had improved, the door was shut to keep the draught out but 
Crustie had clicked. �You can ring my bell�..�</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">Saturday&nbsp; (The longest day of all 
for some of us!)</span></h2>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">Clifden town was 
the first port of call, then onto the �Omey Strand� beach to play in the sand 
where we were surrounded by horseriders.&nbsp; No toilets could be found on the O.S. 
map.&nbsp; No opportunities anywhere to stoop.&nbsp;&nbsp; I was fast running out of time as we 
headed around the headland, I couldn�t hold on any longer.&nbsp; Unknown to the rest 
of us I wasn�t on my own.&nbsp; Crustie who had gone back </span>
<img border="0" src="https://squarryclub.github.io/on tour/Ireland2002/photos/image023.jpg" width="264" height="153" align="left"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">to 
move the cars with Tim was also suffering and found solstice behind a rocky 
outcrop.&nbsp; A beached rowing boat provided an ideal</span><img border="0" src="https://squarryclub.github.io/on tour/Ireland2002/photos/image019.gif" width="168" height="187" align="right"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS"> 
photo opportunity.&nbsp; Get on with it please, I just won�t make it!&nbsp; At last, 
rabbit holes in the sand.&nbsp; Art Garfunkels song rang 
out..�Brown eyes�.&nbsp; Is it right sh..te doesn�t stick to fur?&nbsp;&nbsp; Sadly, the 
rabbits thought they were being treated to marmite soldiers.&nbsp; How wrong they 
were.&nbsp; They�re now all suffering from mixinmetoastees. soz.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">Yet again, Crustie 
had difficulty with his automatic.&nbsp; The damned keys would not come out of the 
ignition until he moved the gear stick into �park�!!&nbsp; On the road again and back 
into Clifden for a beer and relief at last when I found the chemists still open.
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">Wolves 9 Leicester 
1,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stoke 1 Reading 1,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the less said about that the better.&nbsp; Crustie 
attempted to avoid a red lump in the road on the way back from Clifden and JC 
ended up with an egg on his head and currents of wind around his jacksee.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">A minibus was 
hired for the evenings jaunt to Galway.&nbsp; Sadly there weren�t enough seats for 
Shaun or Neil who settled on the wheel arches.&nbsp; John �Travolta� C�s weight must 
have ballooned as he could only fit into his white 46inch waist grease 
lightening trousers.&nbsp; For some odd reason, the Clay Pot Indian was chosen.&nbsp; 
Spike doesn�t normally get wound up these days except when his curry isn�t 
served on a hot plate, there were no currants or egg in his curry, and the way 
it was thrown onto the table!!&nbsp; The gas problems did not help to excuse the poor 
service, both inside and outside the kitchen! So he refused to pay.&nbsp; Why can�t 
they provide a simple hot fruity curry on a hot plate, its not that difficult.&nbsp; 
At least the plates had been produced in the potteries.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">2 girls handed 
invites to Neil and Keith for a local laptop club, why??&nbsp; The pubs were heaving 
and the quieter pubs proved more appealing.&nbsp; Crustie, the air conditioning 
doorman was at it again relieving the pub of its smoke clouds, before we moved 
across the road to Foxeys.&nbsp; Neil went on a walk looking for a phone (why? when 
there was one in the pub).&nbsp; Confirmation of the itinerary predictions almost 
gave Crustie a heart attack.&nbsp; Luckily his explicits �.�f ing w..nker etc helped 
him to chill.&nbsp; Keith began analysing the different expressions used to describe 
going for a pee, turning ones bike around, having a waz etc etc ?? before we 
caught the minibus back to the digs.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">The phantom of the 
ivories (better known as Liberaci Spike) tickled the ivories back in the guest 
house.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">Sunday</span></h2>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">Spike told the 
landlady he was going a day earlier than us to return to old Blighty.&nbsp; She was 
quite relieved and was heard to utter �good, at least I can get some sleep 
now!!�</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">Crusties automatic 
was playing up again.&nbsp; The parking warning light was giving him some grief.&nbsp; A 
wet start to the walk around Ballynahinch Lake disappeared giving out to a 
brightish afternoon.&nbsp; Passing the fly fishermen we lunched at the hotel. Tim 
�Bellamy� discovered an interesting fungi in the shape of a coke bottle top.&nbsp;&nbsp; A 
short stop at a touristy place on return gave an opportunity to purchase 
pressies and cds.&nbsp; Sadly Roy�s �Derriere� was jumping, what a bummer.&nbsp; London&nbsp; 
derry Air at 100db was electric.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">Monday</span></h2>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">On settling up the 
landlady had presumed JC was a blonde haired german boy?? &nbsp;Should be ok in 
Munich mein heiry.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">Panic set in on 
the approach to the toll in the automatic.&nbsp; Crustie had given all his change to 
the arran lifeboat charity.&nbsp; Luckily we hadn�t taken his advice and sailed 
through!!</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">A short bus trip 
and we were back in the heart of Dublin.&nbsp; The crack was good in Temple Bar. 
Sadly the sandwiches had run out, or so they told JC, so we tripped across the 
road to the famous Boxtey Restaurant and washed a meal down with Revolution 
ale.&nbsp; Roy thought he�d pulled again when the waitress in the Boxtey restaurant 
invited him back the following day. However, she did admit to us that she would 
be off duty and wouldn�t be there!</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
