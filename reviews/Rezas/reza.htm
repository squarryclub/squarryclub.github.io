<p>Reza’s ‘Star of India’ , 154 Old Brompton Road, South Kensington,

<p>Sadly, Reza, the chef and star from Delhi Belly (UK TV), wasn’t resident at
the restaurant when we popped in, just a few grumpy waiters. The restaurant was
packed with diners, so it was a good job we’d booked a table several weeks
earlier.</p>
<p>Reza’s can be found on Old Brompton Road, about ½ a mile west of the South
Kensington underground station, and is surrounded by several other restaurants
and pubs. We were shown to a smaller quieter room at the rear of the main dining
area on the ground floor, only big enough for 4 small tables. I didn’t want a
fuss making over my appearance. An upstairs room was also available which I
later discovered was almost as big as downstairs and had its own bar.</p>

uttered a word as they took the orders and served the meals. Evidently, one of
them was polite and even smiled when I later slipped off to the boy’s room.</p>
<p align="left">We
skipped the starters and went for the traditional pappodoms and chutney tray.
Both were presented extremely fresh, just as you’d hope for and gave us
reassurance that the trip had been worthwhile. I wish now we’d have tried a
starter cus they looked really tasty and unusual, unlike the usual common
starters you get at most places.</p>

main courses we chose were Murg Khumb Bahar and Murg Tikka Zafrani; the first
one mainly consisting of chicken, mushrooms and cashew nuts, and mine consisting
of chicken and chillies. A chillie nan and a peshwari rice completed the order
along with a bottle of red wine at around 12 quid. The total bill came to just
under £50. They wouldn’t give me a menu for future reference so this <a href="menu%20only.htm">menu</a> is from memory only.</p>
<p><a href="Image008.jpg"><img border="0" src="Image008_small.jpg" alt="Image008.jpg (2102855 bytes)" width="135" height="101" style="float: left; padding-right: 10"></a>The
décor was unusual with ornately painted ceilings. A couple behind us were
having a right argee bargee with each other which made interesting listening.</p>
<p>The food was excellent and we will definitely be going back. Not huge
helpings, but just right and the quality was excellent. (Shame about the
waiters.)</p>
<p>Yup</p>
