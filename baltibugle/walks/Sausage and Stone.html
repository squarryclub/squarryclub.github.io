&nbsp;<br>
A clear sunny day had been predicted, but with all the rain we had experienced
over the previous few days the wearing of gaiters was recommended.&nbsp; Ali G
hadn’t bought his, but was up for it after missing out on several recent
excursions. A day to build on.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Approx 23 hikers including ladies and Rob's lad and 'Al’s_lad_in' tow turned
up.&nbsp; I knew there was a christmas panto connection there somewhere.&nbsp;
Nige (no_el) and Keith P (I’m on for it) were both down with toesylitis, and
others were either too idle or had other more pressing engagements lined up,
like stopping in bed.&nbsp; What were they missing out on?<br>
<br>
So we set off at 8am up the Trentham Hills from the church car park, nestled
behind the Poachers Cottage on the A34.&nbsp; Bill began sweating and had just
taken his jacket off at the top of the hills when the heavens opened up and the
snow began to fall.&nbsp; This walk was intended to be a repeat of the walk of
3 years or so ago when a few inches of snow has fallen overnight, but without
the snow, ooooer.&nbsp; How amazing was that!<br>
<br>
A slight change from the previous route took us down to the Beech Farm shop
where Richie’s aunt had switched the aga on to warm up a few dozen oatcakes for
us.&nbsp; Spike had picked up the oatcakes earlier and dropped them down to the
shop whilst we were still in bed. &nbsp;What a martyr.&nbsp; It’s these ‘behind
the scenes’ tasks that are so often overlooked and forgotten about.&nbsp; Thanks
Dave.&nbsp; As for the oven, well, you can’t beat the old fashioned types that
don’t work too well.&nbsp; If anyone’s interested you can still find many more
similar models in neck end.<br>
<br>
Having put his coat back on, Bill devoured 4 double oatcakes leaving only a few
scraps for the dogs.<br>
<br>
From the shop we took a slightly different route along to the caves at Beech
before returning to the original route again.<br>
<br>
Some delightful properties were passed along the route.&nbsp; One in particular
at Barlaston boasted several chained up guard dogs and a manicured segregated
footway for us hikers.<br>
<br>
In dribs and drabs, we arrived at the Brushmakers Arms.&nbsp; 3 or 4 of us
wandered into the bar with the locals and spotted the Wippet ale which was
delightful.&nbsp; So we kept that quiet and didn’t tell the rest of the group
who’d headed straight for the lounge.&nbsp;&nbsp;With the infamous words of
Spike in our heads, promising us a great selection of real ales in the Plume of
Feathers, we set off after only one pint.&nbsp; What a mistake that later
turned out to be!<br>
<br>
Our visit to the Plume of Feathers was <b>S</b>hort <b>a</b>nd <b>S</b>wift.&nbsp;
Most of the group had placed their food orders before we realised there was
hardly anything left worth eating.&nbsp; Pushing in before Stevey Mache, we
even failed on the ale front.&nbsp; The Abbott had run out and a decision to
move on had to be&nbsp; taken.&nbsp; Even the&nbsp; ‘boy beardie’ had let us
down by not turning up despite the availability of a cellar full of&nbsp;
smoothflow!&nbsp; Incidently, does anyone know the common connection between
Barry Manilow and smoothflow, besides me and Beardie?&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Leaving the lads and lassie to the lager and the potato-less meals, a small
group of us returned to the tow path in search of real ale and grub.&nbsp; The
whisky liqueurs came in useful at this point, along with Mo’s Roses and Pedro’s
hip flask.&nbsp; A round of guess the contents began.&nbsp; I was almost the
nearest suggesting that it was so smooth it could be Jameson’s whiskey.&nbsp;
However, it turned out to be a German brandy. Perhaps I’d be better in a curry
guessing contest.&nbsp; Never before had we experienced a Christmas walk where
we had only supped one pint by 4pm in the afternoon.&nbsp; And what’s more, we
were to complete the full walk, with no shortcuts or bus rides allegedly.<br>
<br>
Into the Poachers Arms and only an IPA was available.&nbsp; The food was
cracking though.&nbsp; So cracking in fact that a <b>S</b>tone in <b>A</b> <b>S</b>ausage
broke one of Bill’s teeth and immediately set off a claim for
compensation.&nbsp; Pedro’<b>S</b> <b>A</b>rms <b>S</b>hortened as he tried to
avoid buying a round for the umpteenth time.&nbsp; Eventually after having his
arm twisted, he bought a round but was left that short he only had enough
change left to buy himself a half.<br>
<br>
Spike eventually joined us at the Poachers and attempted to embarrass the
manageress by referring to her as a waitress and suggested further compensation
for facelifts, haircuts, etc.&nbsp; He then munched his way through his 4th
packet of crisps to keep his blood pressure up.&nbsp; The rest of the clan
returned to their cars, Ali G hobbling in the pack but ready to build.<br>
<br>
Mo had a pot of tea to settle his tum and searched his pockets for his new
Christmas phone to text his wife Elsie.&nbsp; He’d received several text
messages from her throughout the day but had not got the expertise to reply.
Eventually, after his tea had gone cold, he managed to type out ‘Hi’.&nbsp; 2
minutes later he was cursing as Elsie was sending her replies back too quickly.<br>
<br>
There were several suggestions to the SAS quiz that Spikelett had
promoted.&nbsp; We came up with ‘Spikes always sozzled’ and ‘SOS Send out for
some decent snapping and ale’.&nbsp; Spike’s correct answer of Stoke and
Stafford had to give way though to Bill’s ‘Sausage and Stone’.<br>
<br>
So, the day had gone without a hitch really, except for the oatcakes being cold
and the lunchtime stop; the plume of feathers, having no decent food or real
ale available.&nbsp; Other than that the original walk was superb. The snow
fall was probably the icing on the cake, bringing back memories of the original
walk of 3 years ago, when the oatcakes were piping hot and there was bountiful
amounts of real ale and food including real chips.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Thanks to Spike for organising this one and taking some of this year’s
pressures from my shoulders.&nbsp; Perhaps that’s why my blood pressure has
recently come down and my yuppy flu has gone, or was it that I hadn’t eaten 4
family packets of crisps throughout the day?<br>
<br>
See you at Easter folks when a hike along Hadrian’s Wall will be put together
perhaps by Keith ‘I’m on for it’ Phillips.&nbsp; Watch this space.<br>
