<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">The 
Barton Arm’s experience had been on the cards for some time, and finally, Joe’s 
agonising wait had come to an end.&nbsp; A short trip by train to Brum and we 
sauntered out into the west mids sunshine into New Street.&nbsp; The sun was so 
bright that it dazzled Pedro who almost became the first casualty of the day, 
crossing the road on red, oblivious to the requirements of the green cross 
code.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">Just a few minutes 
from the station, our first stop was The Wellington, a real ale pub with a 
difference.&nbsp; 
The Wellington is a specialist real ale pub with 15 handpulls, which include 
regular beers Wye Valley H.P.A., Purity Mad Goose and Black Country Ales B.F.G, 
Pig on the Wall and Fireside. The other pumps have constantly changing guest 
beers from independent and micro breweries and all are displayed on a computer 
screen at the end of the bar.&nbsp; Another thumbs up for them is that they promote 
the use of their facilities for eating your own food in the bar and 
using their condiments etc.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">The Wye Valley HPA, 
was no 1 and was certainly a no 1 extra blond favourite.&nbsp; Dasher, requested a 
Pig on the wall at no 15, with a 
dash.&nbsp; If looks could kill.&nbsp; We were so lucky not to get thrown out.&nbsp; Ax 
shrugged his shoulders, exclaiming that it was not a pub for the ordinary man, 
as there was no lager or smooth flow.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">After just a couple 
of drinks our thoughts turned to food as we spotted a group of young business 
chappies devouring giant Cornish pasties.&nbsp; Bill, had already eaten, but was not 
to be caught out and eagerly agreed to 
join the rest of us on a sortie to find the Cornish Pastie shop near St Phillips 
Cathedral.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">Sitting in the 
glorious sunshine in the cathedrals grounds we opted to return to the Wellington 
for more of the same, before the long hike to the Barton Arms.&nbsp; We were all 
ready for the off with no delays.&nbsp; It was remarked that perhaps it was because 
JayCee wasn’t with us.&nbsp; Downsized Dave confirmed it was the best no 15 he’d ever 
had, but had no recollection of its name.&nbsp; I suspect it may have been the B.F.G.</span></p>

expected the walk was to take half an hour along the A34 to Mr Tahoohigh’s Holy 
Grail.&nbsp; His dream of visiting a local Oakham’s ale house had finally 
materialised and the long walk had been worth every step, even the ones taken to 
pace footway widths, in the interest of his career development.&nbsp; The pub is one 
of the finest examples of Victorian pub architecture, built in 1901 and one of 
the most beautiful pub interiors in the country. &nbsp;The exterior wasn’t too 
inspiring but the interior, excluding the worse for wear wastrels slumped 
near the entrance, was the personification of Victorian decorative grandeur, 
with rich mahogany wood, stained and engraved windows and mirrors, and wall to 
wall Minton-Hollins tiles, from shiny-glazed decorative patterns to huge painted 
scenes.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">Lord Tahoohigh stood 
against the roaring fire with his ale in hand and a huge grin.&nbsp; He was in 
Heaven.&nbsp; But then so were all of us, with the choice of several Oakhams ales at 
hand, including Bishops Farewell and Asylum, and the sweet aroma of thai food 
filling the rooms.&nbsp; Upsettingly, an attempt to order a small selection failed as 
last food orders stopped at 2.30.&nbsp; Nuts !!&nbsp; Yes they were the only alternative 
as we waited patiently for Richee and Graigee to appear, who had made a belated 
start from Stoke.&nbsp; Oh, and there was a detour incorporated to visit Craigee’s 
financial advisor in the City Centre to review his portfolio.&nbsp; Luckily we had 
several barrels available to empty.&nbsp; Pedro was seen supping Bishops Farewell in 
a straight glass, and was elevated to the ranks of the enlightened.&nbsp; Joe was 
either in, or on, ecstasy and was gleefully inspecting every aspect of the 
building, taking photos at every opportunity.&nbsp; </span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">Finally, Rich and 
Craigee arrived so we forced ourselves to sup another one before inviting the 
barmaid to take a group picture of the gang on the sweeping wrought-iron 
staircase.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">Axe’s taxis arrived 
(well done Axe) to take us to the Anchor in Digbeth, which we’d visited only a 
couple of years ago.&nbsp; Despite the varied selection of 
ales, most were awful and Trig was yawning.&nbsp; A resounding vote to depart quickly 
was taken.&nbsp; A photo opportunity arose at the Bull ring with Axe attempting to 
be born again.</span></p>

route to the indian in Broad Street, took us past the grade two listed Old Joint 
Stock, a Fuller’s pub, so 
it would have been 
inconsiderate of us not to call in.&nbsp; Like the Barton Arms, as you step inside 
the huge front doors you step back in time to Victorian splendour. &nbsp;Above the 
pub, I’ve just discovered, is an 80-seater studio theatre which hosts music 
nights, comedy nights, one-off evenings and a whole range of plays.&nbsp; We had a 
comedy sketch of our own though to watch at the bar as the juggling glass of Mr 
Tahoohigh magically swung to and fro without spilling a drop until the drum roll 
and Dasher was baptised from head to foot.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">The waiters at the 
Barajee Indian were happy to see us stumble in and showed us to a discrete table 
in the far distant corner out of harms way; or so they thought.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">A couple of bottles 
of house wine were ordered whilst Trig perused the wine list and ordered some 
top plonk.&nbsp; A few Cobras appeared along with excellent food and a surplus 
collection for the bill provided an opportunity to order a selection of either 
sambuccas or brandies.&nbsp; It was Trigglet’s first ever sambucca.&nbsp; To celebrate 
Tone christened the table with his beer and Arsonist Axe decided to light the 
table with his sambucca in the absence of candles.&nbsp; The waiters ran over to join 
in the fun.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">Yes, oh what fun !!&nbsp; 
It was time to move on and return to the station, led by Dasher, after what had 
been a truly memorable day.&nbsp; There were fire engines everywhere.&nbsp; Craigee began 
humming his Chelsea building society motto ‘TLC, tender loving care not plc’ on 
the train back.&nbsp; How does it go again?? And ‘respect for tiling’ was proposed by 
Mid Week Tone which was widely supported. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">Amidst the euphoria, 
Dasher and Mid Week Tone announced their suggestion of a mysterious mystery 
night which they would put together later in the year.&nbsp; Would it include an 
Indian, would it include real ale?&nbsp; Maybe not.&nbsp; We’ll have to wait and see 
………………</span></p>
