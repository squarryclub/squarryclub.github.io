<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">A 
Titanic Struggle &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stoke to Jalsa &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 30<sup>th</sup> May 2008</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">All 
aboard who were going aboard were:&nbsp; Yup, Pedro, Mid Week Tone, JayCee, Keithee, 
Downsize Dave (Byrne the Bolt), Granpop Bill, Craigee, Richee, Triglette, 
Spikelet, Mr Tahoohigh and Dan the Man.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Yup, 
Pedro, JayCee, Keithee, Dave the Byrne Bolt and Granpop Bill, eager to get 
started, met up earlier than the rest at the White Star, Titanic’s latest pub in 
Stoke.&nbsp; Pedro let us into his conspiracy theories; one of which was that the 
Titanic ship had square port holes and therefore the one that sank in the film 
couldn’t have been the right one because it had round holes; or was it the other 
way round? After more ale and feeling sea sick, we agreed.&nbsp; We were slightly 
sceptical though until his second theory was proved correct; that JayCee uses 
his colostomy bag to keep his change in.&nbsp; Out it came ….. he was spot on.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Having 
proved this theory to be correct, Pedro was keen to see the change spent, and 
persuaded JayCee to part with it for another Iceberg before we headed off to our 
next port of call, the Jolly Potter.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The 
regular bus service came in handy for hobbling Yup and Granpop Bill, who took 
great delight in smiling at the grumpy driver as he flashed his free bus pass 
under his nose. &nbsp;Paul Baddeley of the town hall, was sitting on the bus and gave 
a glowing recommendation of the Wolverhampton’s beer festival which he’d just 
returned from.&nbsp; It couldn’t have been that good though cus he was still 
coherent.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">
Disappointingly, the Jolly Potter was found to be shut and rumour has it that it 
is now permanently closed its doors.&nbsp; One person who used to frequent the Jolly 
Potter, when he were a lad, was Triglett, who suddenly appeared out of nowhere 
to join us.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Waiting 
for another bus to take Yup, Granpop and Trig to the Greyhound at Hartshill, the 
three took a quick gander at the Robin Hood across the road. The rest of the 
lads walked on to the Greyhound.&nbsp; 2 seconds was enough to prove why the Robin 
Hood had never appeared in any real ale guides, or even any recommended pub 
guide for that matter.&nbsp; Standing, waiting at the bus stop outside a terraced 
house, a dead hanging basket hung limply from a rusty hook. ‘Hung, drawn and not 
watered’, as Triglett accurately described it.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">
Finally, we joined up in the Greyhound with Craigee, Richee, Mid week Tone, 
Spikelet, and last but not least Josepe and Dan the Man, who arrived shortly 
after.&nbsp; A sneeze from Spikelette, strong enough to have blown a ship off course, 
bellowed out across the entire room.&nbsp; Another longitude over here Joseph shouted 
out to keep him on course, or was it just the old premium in disguise? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">As 
usual, future events were dreamt up, particularly by top organiser, Lionel 
Richee.&nbsp; Amongst the ideas was a possible clay shooting event for later this 
year (July/August), or maybe next year.&nbsp; Triglet declared he’d be no good at it 
even though his name is Trigger.&nbsp; With that, we sank our pints and moved on to 
the Jalsa at the allotted time of 9.15, where we were told we’d have half an 
hour’s wait before the table was ready. &nbsp;Without much ado, we moved swiftly into 
the Museum, just up (or was it down?) the road, and tested their ale.&nbsp; Downsize 
Dave couldn’t wait for the grub, and ‘bolted’ in search of fast food.&nbsp; Someone 
asked Granpop Bill when it was he retired the first time before returning to 
Stoke.&nbsp; ‘I shall finish when my hearing aid packs up’, he replied.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The 
table was at last ready for us, and as Keithee was past his best, Triglet did 
the honourable deed and chose wine no 4, a smooth cabernet sauvignon.&nbsp; An 
excellent choice as ever, I think!</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The 
service was slow, the poppodoms were late, and Yup’s curry had to be sent back 
to the kitchen to be replaced with the one he’d ordered.&nbsp; Craigee had more 
chillies than he could handle and soon began to drip liberally over the table.&nbsp; 
The chillies also hit Spikelet who also bolted in search of fresh air.&nbsp; In all, 
a fairly good meal, but with poor service the tip was reduced accordingly, and 
the surplus was put to one side to boost the xmas fund.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">We fell 
out of the Indian and soon dispersed into different directions. Pedro carried a 
glass of red wine to the A34 where he bribed Keithee’s daughter into giving him 
a lift home. Somehow the rest of us got home in taxis.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Regards</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">
Yupmeister</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">(enjoy 
yer baltis)</span></p>
