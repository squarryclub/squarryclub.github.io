<div style="font-family:'.SF NS Text';font-size:15px;color:#000000;">
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span style="font-family:'Comic Sans MS';font-size:16px;"><strong>Oct 25th London. </strong></span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span style="font-family:'Comic Sans MS';font-size:16px;">First stop was The Garden Gate (after the underground to Belsize Park) where the ale choice was fair but the food was disappointing. Roadrunner and Iffy (59 the following day) caught us up after a train connection had delayed them. Jaycee was enjoying his first full day out since his op and despite experiencing grimly maintained toilets, he survived the day. </span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span style="font-family:'Comic Sans MS';font-size:16px;">A short stroll up to the Parliament Hill Viewpoint provided us with with a good but cloudy view over the London skyline. </span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span style="font-family:'Comic Sans MS';font-size:16px;">The Southampton Arms was our next port of call. A typical London boozer with a fair selection of drinks. </span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span style="font-family:'Comic Sans MS';font-size:16px;">We took the underground from Tufnell Park Station to The Archway Station where an unexpected climb unfolded to Highgate Cemetery. The admission fee of &pound;4 and limited time available swayed the decision to continue instead to the next pub. Bill jumped the barrier to spend a penny but voluntarily paid a &pound;1 for the privilege. </span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span style="font-family:'Comic Sans MS';font-size:16px;">The Dukes Head also provided a good selection of ales and there was even time for a couple before racing for the bus; which turned up 5 minutes or so late!! </span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span style="font-family:'Comic Sans MS';font-size:16px;">Back in Fleet Street, Hampstead, earlier than anticipated, there was a surprise bonus pub; The Stag with time for a swift one. </span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span style="font-family:'Comic Sans MS';font-size:16px;">The Rajdoot was ready and waiting for us when we arrived at 6.15pm.The service and food was very good indeed with great feedback. </span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span style="font-family:'Comic Sans MS';font-size:16px;">After a short stroll to Belsize Park we returned quickly on the northern line down to Euston where most trains were delayed due to trespassing on the main line. Time for a stop at the Euston Tap!! </span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span style="font-family:'Comic Sans MS';font-size:16px;">We all eventually managed to get home safely. The following day all trains were cancelled due to the horrific floods. We were lucky!!</span></div>
