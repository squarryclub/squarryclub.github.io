<p class="MsoNormal"><b>
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">Jalsa Night - Friday 
28<sup>th</sup> April 06</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">Swingers up for it 
were: Yup, Richee, Ali Gee, R G Bargee, Bolt from the Blue, Pedro, Stubbee, 
Argumentative Ade, </span>
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">Keith Crafty-hold 
and </span><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">
Triglett.&nbsp; There was no response from Jaycee for this one but having spent a 
couple of days throwing up in Vegas he can perhaps be forgiven on this 
occasion.&nbsp; Celebrating a wedding anniversary in style obviously doesn’t agree 
with him.&nbsp; Craigee and Scottee letting us down on the night will never be 
forgotten, despite much grovelling.&nbsp; Why has Craigee’s garden wall been rebuilt 
on the scunt??</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">The evening began 
early for Pedro, being persuaded to down a quick’un at the Westbury, by Picasso 
who had dropped him off before returning home to paint another mural.&nbsp; The 
evening nearly came to an abrupt end for Yup as he emerged through the hole in 
the hedge to be frightened to near death by Stubbee who had hidden in the 
shadows.&nbsp; Picking himself up off the floor and managing to collect Pedro on 
route, the threesome made their way by foot to the Orange tree to meet up with 
the other squarrites.&nbsp; ‘Lollipop lady’ Pedro ensured we looked both ways as we 
crossed the dual carriageway sections opposite from the Westbury !!??</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">Lionel was already 
supporting the bar at the Orange Tree, supping a pint of Guinness and getting to 
know the young barman !!&nbsp; The barman also acknowledged the fact that Yup was a 
nice boy and was impressed by the fact he’d been barred from the pub some 30 
years ago, bless.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">Out of the blue came 
bolt from the blue, followed by AA, Crafty Hold, Triglett, Ali Gee and R G 
Bargee.&nbsp; Triglett recalled a hen party held at the Orange tree many years ago 
and the fun the girls had had throwing some poor blokes pants around above his 
head. &nbsp;They had called the game ‘Trig in the middle’ although he declared it had 
nothing to do with him!!&nbsp; He never did get them back!!</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">There was time for a 
swift half for some before the decision to venture forth was made to check out 
the recently refurbished London Tavern at a cost of ¼ million quid.&nbsp; Sadly, 
they’d have been better off spending it on some real ale.&nbsp; The only drinks 
available were Hancocks HB and Boddingtons, neither of which were drinkable so 
we left them and moved around the corner to the Castle Mona; even the Bombardier 
and Abbott ales back at the Orange Tree were preferable. &nbsp;What a difference.&nbsp; 
Bombardier and Pedi were available and as we left later we discovered Flowers 
was also on in the other bar; bugger.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">There were no pork 
pies to be had but Ali s’pied some large baps which partly made up for it.&nbsp; 
Talking of baps, Trig just happened to mention ‘men and motors’ an intellectual 
documentary type of programme, which he described in detail to us.&nbsp; We were 
spellbound.&nbsp; Unable to remember the number of the sky channel RG Bargee 
instantly confirmed it was no 131 - The Discovery Channel !!&nbsp; So much for 
revising for his exams.&nbsp; He may have had no idea of the bus times back to 
neck-end, and doesn’t buy any beer, but at least we all know now what channel 
men and motors is on…..</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">Clambering over the 
pile of bap crumbs in front of Ali after a visit to the gents, Trig and Pedro 
recollected their fears of heights, cliff faces, tall buildings etc. and both 
agreed that they shared similar mentalities; oooh, spooky.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">AA, Crafty and 
Richee were dragged away from the bar to embark on the walk to the Indian.&nbsp; 
Sadly we’d run out of time to call into the Museum.&nbsp; Tears streamed from Pedro’s 
eyes at the thought of missing it out, as we slipped through the byways and 
alleyways and Stubbees Walk to the Indian.&nbsp; Ali was surprised to find we could 
get through as he’d spent many a night gritting the streets in the area and was 
confident we wouldn’t find a way through.&nbsp; Probably too busy eating baps…..</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">A long table awaited 
us.&nbsp; We then awaited a long time to be served until Triglett blasted the owner, 
a past acquaintance from an Indian cottage in Boslem.&nbsp; Pedro wished he’d bough a 
tin of alloo chat with him, he was so hungry.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">Trig expertly 
ordered several bottles of Californian wine, and eventually the food was 
ordered, including the obligatory ‘crisps’ and chutneys along with alloo and 
chicken chats for the hogs;&nbsp; Stubbee, Pedro and Triglett.&nbsp; The special biriani 
came highly recommended and we weren’t let down.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">At around 9.30 ish 
it was 2 pies less trek time for Ali Gee as he’s normally sitting up at the 
Royal Oak at Harriseahead at this time scoffing pies with R G Bargee.&nbsp; (It was 
rumoured that Stubbee scoffs 3 wrights pies every Wednesday and is now on 5 a 
day in training for the pie factory!!)&nbsp; Reminiscing later Ali scuttled off for 
an impromptu fandango in the toilets to work off his baps.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">The food was 
excellent and commended by all.&nbsp; Crafty, not yet converted to real ale, also 
commended the lager. &nbsp;AA mentioned an Indian in Dubai he could recommend, so 
we’ll add it to the ever-growing list of possibles if we ever win on the 
lottery.&nbsp; Pedro proposed a short walk from John O’Groats to Lands End when we’ve 
retired.&nbsp; Yup agreed providing we visited every Indian en-route and Pedro didn’t 
use his lollipop when crossing roads.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">Ali attempted to 
blow the candle out in the heated tray but failed.&nbsp; Surprising really, with his 
years of experience with candles, the only source of power in neck-end.&nbsp; It was 
however, way past his bed time and he was buggered after his improvised 
fandango.&nbsp; RGee took his arm and led him off to the bus station.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">Bolt from the Blue 
and Richee agreed to jointly write up a short review of the restaurant, but I 
haven’t seen them yet!!&nbsp; The ‘You’ve been Bugled’ calling card came out and 
marks were awarded. &nbsp;7 or 8 out of 10 was first intimated until we were told in 
no uncertain terms that we couldn’t place any last orders of sambucas or 
brandies&nbsp; The marks plummeted long with the tip. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">Yupmeister</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">(enjoy yer baltis)</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">PS Ali Gee never had 
one bap…………..allegedly!)</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
