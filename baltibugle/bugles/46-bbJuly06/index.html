<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">Stone Beer Fest 
Friday 14<sup>th</sup> July&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<img border="0" src="https://www.baltibugle.co.uk/bugles/46-bbJuly06/MMAG00517_0000[1].gif" width="105" height="115"></span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">Up for it were:&nbsp; 
Keithee, Stubbee, Craigee, Richee, Jay Cee, DCeen and MCeen, Mid-week Tone, 
Pedro and Yup. &nbsp;Q A arrived around 920, after his Porsche had let him down.&nbsp; 
Grant also let him down by going on the pull in Castle but we were happy with 
the pulling of a different kind – yes, real ale.&nbsp; Also arriving late were Spike, 
Ali G and RGee who had missed the bus by 2 minutes, cus Ali was finishing his 
pies off for his tea.</span></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">There were no takers 
for the minutes.&nbsp; Shame, a chance for someone to get their own back.&nbsp; So, as 
usual, I reluctantly borrowed a spare pen from the bar and jotted a couple of 
notes down:</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">DCeen organised the 
ABC minibus which rolled up on time at the Westbury.&nbsp; Arriving in Stone, the 
driver decided to take us through the park instead of dropping us at the door of 
the Swan.&nbsp; The walk was obviously too much for Stubbee who walked straight into 
a bollard.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">The token procedure 
was on again tonight which you could use both in the rear courtyard or at the 
main bar and this year only Scottish ales were available for the festival.&nbsp; 
Incidentally, Mr Tahoohigh called at the Swan the following night but failed in 
his attempt to find the beer festival in the courtyard, and that was before he’d 
had a drink.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">The list was 
extensive but excluded Matt’s Ibstock brick which he’d recently requested and 
made a *rick of himself.&nbsp; The nibbledick (niblick), (hopeful thinking!!) proved 
too much of a temptation for JayCee following the disappointment that the 
sheepshagger was off.&nbsp; After one small mouthful, as they say, it was time to try 
another.&nbsp; DCeen and McCeen nabbed a corner on the decking and nibbled away at 
pork pies.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">As we tried the ales 
we marked them out of 10.&nbsp; The Harviestoun Natural Blonde 19 was awarded 8/10 by 
Craigee, followed by a 3 from Yup.&nbsp; The ‘golds’ and the ‘blondes’ took a 
hammering and took the highest marks, the Galloway Gold, Harviestoun Natural 
Blonde and Ben Nevis being awarded the highest marks on the night.&nbsp; JayCees 
nibbledick only got a one.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">Spike making a guest 
appearance after a period of 6 months asked Stubbee if he’d had the dog yet.&nbsp; We 
couldn’t find it on the list but then realised he was actually referring to a 
golden retriever he was in the process of buying for the kids; but not its 
brother&nbsp; aaahhh.&nbsp; Spike then engaged in a head to head with a wench who liked a 
bit of a head evidently.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">The last and only 
bottle of ‘bitter and twisted’ was purchased by Yup for 2 tokens, sparking off a 
clamour for the remaining ones.&nbsp; One or two disappeared into the bar and 
purchased from yet another fine array of ales, including Old Priory from Joules 
which Keithee tried on at least 2 occasions.&nbsp; Richee bought a pint of vinegar 
from the front bar and Pedro, duly returned it for him for a decent pint.&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">9.15ish and we 
sauntered up to try the relatively new Indian; The Ovilash, in Radford St. which 
had recently replaced the Mexican.&nbsp; DC’s tantrums began as the waiters struggled 
to seat us downstairs and returned again as we waited for the starters.&nbsp; Has 
anyone noticed the similarity with Nikki from Big Brother?</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">During the meal Ade 
raised interest in a titanic adventure.&nbsp; ‘Squarrites - all at sea’ seemed a 
possibility for next year, and several took the bait.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">The meal was in fact 
pretty average when it finally arrived and I don’t think we’ll be returning.&nbsp; 
The minor delays also meant we were late for the bus back home which we missed 
by around 10 minutes or so.&nbsp; He’d given up on us and went for his next pick up 
before returning for us around an hour later.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">There wasn’t a lot 
to do except hang around outside Wetherspoons.&nbsp; Managing to sneak into 
Granvilles, Yup and Spike were seen motioning ‘shaking your arse’ to the top 
tottee music.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">Yupmeister</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">(Enjoy yer baltis)</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">PS There is no do 
planned for August.&nbsp; The next Squarry do is to be wednesday 13<sup>th</sup> 
September - a 16-a-side crown green bowling match against Rob Belcher’s Stafford 
Sparklers, including real ale and followed by a curry in Stafford.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">PPS October’s 
squarry night will be at either the Balti Kitchen or more likely the Raj in 
Macclesfield.&nbsp; To be followed very early in December by the mystery which may 
include not one, not two, but possibly 3 pub visits prior to the Indian!!!&nbsp; Or 
is that the first red herring?</span></p>
