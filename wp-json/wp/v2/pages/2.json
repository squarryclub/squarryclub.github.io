As the weeks went by, a visit to local hostelries after the squash became routine. At the end of every month, after \u2018pay\u2019 day, a trip to an indian restaurant also crept in.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">As the years went by and some of the members became less able to play squash without sustaining an injury, the squash was dropped. The monthly curry nights however, along with visits to real ale establishments and breweries have continued. Other Squarry events include office walks which began in 1992, annual trips abroad and trips to the gee gees. Rounds of golf are played by some and outings to cricket and footie matches are also slipped in from time to time. The club has expanded somewhat, in all respects! It has now developed into a group of about 80 members, or \u2018Squarrites\u2019.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/squarryclub.github.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/07\/TN_service-squash.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox[2]\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-494 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/squarryclub.github.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/07\/TN_service-squash.jpg\" alt=\"TN_service squash\" width=\"190\" height=\"256\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>The Yupmeister<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Our website was created by the Squarry Club founder, the one and only legend, Dave Stevens \u2013 otherwise known as Yup, Yuppy or The Yupmeister! Yup dedicated much of his time to the organisation of countless events near and far, which you can read about on the website. Thanks to Yup\u2019s hard work, Squarrites have enjoyed many happy times together and Yup always brought fun and laughter to any occasion. Behind the scenes, Yup would organise Squarry branded items such as calendars, t-shirts and pens. Yup enjoyed using quirky puns and always signed off his emails with an apt phrase, \u201cEnjoy yer&#8230;\u201d So, we hope you \u201cEnjoy yer Website!\u201d<\/p>\n<p>When the news came that Yup had suddenly passed away due to the rapid deterioration in his health, his family, friends and all the Squarrites were devastated, to put it mildly.
