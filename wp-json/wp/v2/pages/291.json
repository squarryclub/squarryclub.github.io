Wine was ordered at the very cheap price of less than \u00a35 a bottle, but was soon rejected by most, who changed to the Cobra. \u00a0The pops and starters went down well but the mains weren\u2019t of very good quality and Yuppers gave the owner some feedback that may have been a little harsh.

The inside is contemporary and spotlessly clean. The food is well presented and the service excellent. Drinks were provided on the house after the meal which cost \u00a345 for 2 including starters and wine. The pappodoms and accompaniments were almost the best ever and the peshwari nan breads, lightly covered with honey were scrumptious. The onion bhajis were disappointing. The main courses were good.

Probably, not to the strength and quantity for your die-hard curry members, but as a starter to compare with others it was tasty, but not overwhelming.Very \u2018upmarket\u2019 surroundings; service was good if slightly rushed (we\u2019d only just been shown to our table, when we being asked for our drinks order!). I suspect it was as much to do with the need to \u2018turn over\u2019 tables, as it was good service, given that it was full.

So we did.The restaurant was buzzing. A couple of parties were in and there was some pretty loud music playing in the background. Luckily the hotel we were staying in had made our booking, otherwise I doubt if we\u2019d got in. It was bulging to bursting. We sat talking to some locals in the bar area before the meal who had been using the restaurant for over 13 years and praised the quality and the staff before leaving. The Nawaabs is part of an international chain, there\u2019s also one in Leeds, Bradford and Manchester evidently. They recommended lamb chops for starters \u2026.. so we went along with it.Top marks to the quality of the food. Baltis are presented in a small balti dish and are much drier than the stokey baltis. They are however, very tasty. We shared a Nirali special and the chicken badami with the obligatory peshwari nan bread and pilau rice. Couldn\u2019t fault anything really except the waiters, who were a bit reserved you might say, but very efficient. No photo of the bogs cus I didn\u2019t have my camera, but they were above average condition. \u00a0A large mirror adorned the far wall making the place appear bigger than it was, but giving a bigger panoramic view for anyone sitting facing the wall. The prices were reasonable; \u00a340 total for two including the bottles of merlot and cobra. Shame it\u2019s too far out for an evenings trip, or is it?

The restaurant was packed with diners, so it was a good job we\u2019d booked a table several weeks earlier.Reza\u2019s can be found on Old Brompton Road, about \u00bd a mile west of the South Kensington underground station, and is surrounded by several other restaurants and pubs. We were shown to a smaller quieter room at the rear of the main dining area on the ground floor, only big enough for 4 small tables. I didn\u2019t want a fuss making over my appearance. An upstairs room was also available which I later discovered was almost as big as downstairs and had its own bar. \u00a0The service was pretty efficient, but the waiters appeared grumpy and hardly uttered a word as they took the orders and served the meals. Evidently, one of them was polite and even smiled when I later slipped off to the boy\u2019s room.We skipped the starters and went for the traditional pappodoms and chutney tray. Both were presented extremely fresh, just as you\u2019d hope for and gave us reassurance that the trip had been worthwhile. I wish now we\u2019d have tried a starter cus they looked really tasty and unusual, unlike the usual common starters you get at most places.The main courses we chose were Murg Khumb Bahar and Murg Tikka Zafrani; the first one mainly consisting of chicken, mushrooms and cashew nuts, and mine consisting of chicken and chillies. A chillie nan and a peshwari rice completed the order along with a bottle of red wine at around 12 quid. The total bill came to just under \u00a350. They wouldn\u2019t give me a menu for future reference so this\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/baltibugle.co.uk\/reviews\/Rezas\/menu%20only.htm\" target=\"_blank\">menu\u00a0<\/a>is from memory only.The d\u00e9cor was unusual with ornately painted ceilings. A couple behind us were having a right argee bargee with each other which made interesting listening.The food was excellent and we will definitely be going back. Not huge helpings, but just right and the quality was excellent. (Shame about the waiters.) Mr &amp; Mrs Yup. \u00a0Obviously more expensive than most but well worth a visit.A squarry visit was finally made by the Squarrites in Nov 2011.<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\" width=\"201\">Taste of India, Poseidonos Ave., Aliathon Hotel, Shopping Centre, Paphos,Cyprus<\/td>\n<td valign=\"top\">Visited August 08.

Beer and wine had been previously delivered, as the restaurant is unlicensed, and all seemed to go down well.

The quality of food was described as one of the best ever by several of the group. Fresh, crisp poppodoms were promptly bought to the table after our order. Fair and tasty portions of chutneys. Nans were cut into quarters to save having to rip them apart.Large bottles of Cobra were around a fiver each with wine being too expensive starting at around \u00a318. The 2 for 1 main course deal is well worth taking advantage of if you can vacate the table by around 7.30pm.

There were specials, standard curries and BBQ\u2019s available, clay pots and tin pots, and real ale\/guest beers at the bar. What more could a man want.The BBQ\u2019s were \u00a33.50 whilst the main dishes including rices and nan were a bargain at around \u00a37.50. There were all types of meat available, but when asked if we wanted goat curry, well, \u2018you\u2019ve got to be kidding\u2019, someone bleated.Several went for the bbq\u2019d hot chicken tikka masalla, which lived up well to its description, and then a honey and chillie chicken main at \u00a34.25, with rice and nan at around an extra couple of quid each. There was no final bill to settle up as you paid for your meal when ordering.\u00a0 The route to Kendrick Park metro station, about 10 minutes away was a poorly lit area. I wouldn\u2019t recommend this route if you hadn\u2019t got Granpop Bill with you.<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Indian Restaurant Reviews \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Feel free to send in your reviews.\u00a0 One squarrite, who can&#8217;t be named,\u00a0left a comment &#8216;Effing good breakfast&#8217;\u00a0 in a guest book in a &#8216;b&amp;b&#8217;\u00a0in Ireland.
