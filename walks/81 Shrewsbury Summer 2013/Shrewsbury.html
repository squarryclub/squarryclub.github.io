4th�6th July 2013 </font></b>
</p>
<p><b><u>Up for it were:</u></b> Jaycee, Keithee, Anytime Tone, Jacko, Yuppy, Mr Tahoohigh, 
Ali G, Granpop Bill, Dasher, Pedro, Mothy, Roadrunner, Stand Back Dave and 
Debris. </p>
<p><b><u>Thursday 4th July </u></b> </p>
<p>Bus buddies Keithee, Mr Tahoohigh and Jacko met Pedro and Ali G at Newcastle 
Bus Station to catch the bus to Shrewsbury. The bus which had just come from 
Shrewsbury, should have gone to Hanley and back to Newcastle, but had broken 
down because it had run out of water. </p>
<p>Pedro who was a truck macomic in a previous incarnation pontificated that 
cold water could not be used as the engine was warm and to use a technical term 
�it would bugger it up�. So we waited for a man to come from Hanley who was 
authorized to fill it up with approved First Bus Company hot water. Fortunately 
this only delayed us three quarters of an hour and at least one pint. </p>
<p>Panic set in before we started as Pedro lost his wallet. No one had ever seen 
it and nobody knew what it looked like. However, Mr Fagin Tahoohigh recognized 
it by a white five pound note taped to its inside and �inadvertently� put it in 
his own pocket. Eventually the bus set off for Market Drayton with a chorus of 
�You�ve got to pick a pocket or two�. </p>
<p>We should have met Mothy at Loggerheads but we didn�t, as we were running 
late and Mothy thinking he was late got Mrs Mothy to drive like a maniac to 
Market Drayton where we did. No such problem with Anytime Tone even though it 
was mid-week (ish). </p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">After a pleasant journey to Shrewsbury we eventually caught up with the rest 
of the lads and one Debri outside the Shrewsbury Inn, and booked all the best 
rooms. There was a bit of drama with some confusion about the number of rooms 
booked, however it was soon sorted and the lads paired up in a room sharing way 
except for Jacko who slept in a cupboard adjacent to Mr Tahoohigh and Ali�s 
room.

As a first move (about 100 yards up the road actually) the lads popped into 
the nearby CAMRA approved, Salop Inn, for a quick one. Ali G recommended the 
Fyne Ales ���. which by all accounts seemed to go down very well, particularly 
with the pork pies which were also very good. 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was a �Fyne� day so it was 
decided to adjourn to the nearby beer garden on the pavement outside to soak up 
some fumes, since this beer garden was on the footway next to the main road! </p>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">Later that evening, high on fumes, beer and pork pies, we set off for a walk 
to the Salopian Brewery and arrived in a mere three quarters of an hour and what 
would have done for an office walk. The man who should have taken us round had 
the sense to have the afternoon off, thus landing us with the Managing Director 
who had the pleasure of looking after us. We had a very short talk and tour 
before he realized that we had heard it all before and anyway he probably 
noticed Mr Tahoohigh swaying on the edge of his cleaning bath and clearly 
thought there�d be too much paper work to fill in if somebody drowned in there 
and so we headed for more beer and buffet. This was in the executive suite (an 
old out building at the side of an even older office with a couple of settees 
and some chairs rescued from a care home). Mr Tahoohigh distracted him with idle 
brewing talk and ended up completely out of his brains while the rest sensibly 
scoffed all the buffet and drink. Mr Tahoohigh then continued the verbal 
onslaught with MD firmly trapped behind the bar well into the evening. </p>

&nbsp;<p>Granpop Bill 
seemed fine the next morning but Mr Tahoohigh had no recollection of this (or 
most of the previous evening, including lying on his bed in his underpants like 
Cleopatra going on about how Granpop Bill got him home!) suspecting the Salopian 
Oracle made have interfered somehow with his memory. There was definitely 
something in the air as we were walking back (not that! that was later). Ali 
could smell it from a 100 yards back. It was Yup�s chips. So completely losing 
interest in Mr Tahoohigh�s welfare or crab like walking, decided Yup (and chips) 
would be much better company.

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">The walk consisted of a stroll 
up Caer Cadoc across The Lawley (which is a nice name for two bloody great 
hills) to Great Ryton. However the greatness of these hills probably depended on 
your level of fitness. Most of the group galloped of at a pace up Caer Cadoc but 
Mr Tahoohigh and Ali G walked/climbed very slowly to give the hill and their 
hearts the respect they deserved but mostly to be able to catch their breath.
</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">Having got to the top of Caer Cadoc a brief stop was taken and Jaycee offered 
round the �County Wounty Bounty Bars�. After admiring the view we scrambled / 
abseiled to the bottom to return to the same level we started. Along the way we 
seemed to acquire a sheep dog which decided to do as sheep dogs do and started 
to round up some sheep. But at least that got shut of it, clearly the dog 
preferred the excitement and challenge of rounding up sheep to rounding up a 
bunch of old farts on an away day. </p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">Perhaps distracted by the nutty dog some of the group hardly seemed to notice 
there were hills at all, and as mentioned some of us struggled and one bloody 
great hill was enough. In fairness to the Yupmeister, like with pies, one�s 
never enough, so he continued on for a bite of the second �summit� with the 
fitter folks of the bunch. Apparently this is part of the Shrewsbury Way from 
Church Stretton to Shrewsbury. The route is very popular with SAS survival 
training groups, the Army and people running up and down hills in their vest and 
underpants in extreme weather conditions. </p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">So, in front of us stood The Lawley, another stroll to the top then back down 
again. Those of us who could read maps and had had enough of big hills realized 
it was not necessary to go over the top and repeat the previous climb and so 
walked the level path alongside. You couldn�t see owt, but the view up the hill 
was great. Meanwhile in the spirit of the Grand old Duke of York the others went 
up and over; overtaking Graham Turner and his Shrewsbury Football team.</p>

after the walk. We met Pedro and Keithee who were sliding under a table outside 
the Fox in the warm August sunshine. Both appeared to have consumed the 
recommend 2 units of alcohol a day (and the rest of the week). Unfortunately 
somebody had decided to have a bit of an accident on the A49 resulting in every 
motorist and his dog/combine harvester /tractor using the narrow country lanes 
which ruled out the planned bus trip back to good old Shrewsbury. We witnessed a 
stand-off between some hooray henry in an open top sports car and a JCB. The 
sports car reversed very quickly when the JCB lowered his bucket and revved up. </td>

<p>With the help of �the nice lad behind the bar� we managed to summon up a 
fleet of taxis to get us back to Shrewsbury. Not only that, the landlady, in an 
act of charity, volunteered to keep the pub open. So all�s well that ends well 
as they say. </p>
<p>We got back to Wetherspoons by taxi about 5ish for a quick freshen up, then 
out on the town again for a quick drink at the 3 Fishes Inn near the Bear Steps 
which again was an exceptional pint in an exceptional pub before strolling off 
for the curry. </p>
<p>After the curry some headed for a last drink at the Nag�s Head, and some 
concluded with a last one at the Wethers before heading up the wooden hills in 
readiness for home on Saturday. So another cracking do, walk and weather, with 
cracking ale and cracking food, and for Mr Tahoohigh a cracking head where Ali G 
hit him with a chair in the night to shut him up! </p>
<p><b><u>Saturday 6th Aug </u></b> </p>
<p>Breakfast at Wetherspoons, then back to Stoke (some on the same bus that 
broke down before) for the Stokees, whilst Stubby took the Westbury lads home.
</p>
<p>Cheers </p>
<p>Mr Tahoohigh</p>
