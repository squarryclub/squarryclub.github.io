<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">Autumn Walk 13<sup>th</sup> 
October 2006</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">Down at the Old 
Bull and Bush</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">Up for it were Jacko, 
Keithee, Yup, Mid-week Tone, Mr Tahoohigh, Spiklett, Zolett and Gerbel, JayCee 
and Pedro.&nbsp; Tiny Tim and JayN (Thingy) met up with us at the start.&nbsp; Mo was 
excused with a bug.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">It was an early 
start for most, leaving the Westbury at 7am.&nbsp; Darren, the supreme minibus 
driver, was using his ‘nat sav’ for the first time.&nbsp; No-one amongst us could 
work it or pronounce sat nav so he fathomed it out himself and punched in Himley, 
nr Dudley.&nbsp; It seemed to work as we headed down the motorway through the mist 
and seemingly in the right direction.&nbsp; Each time we approached a speed camera it 
emitted an ever increasing number of beeps, interfering with the league cup 
final from 1972 which we were all glued to. (except for Pedro)</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">The sat nav had done 
it’s job and we touched down in Himley at 8o’clock prompt, not quite where we 
were supposed to be starting off from, but within a couple of a hundred yards or 
so.&nbsp; Following a group photee we set off walking in a northerly direction at 
8.25am along the railway walk from the car park.&nbsp; This was a straight forward 
start to the walk after which we entered a housing site and dropped down onto a 
towpath.&nbsp; The first hurdle of finding a route off the towpath was tricky but two 
nice old ladies speaking in some weird dialect which we couldn’t understand 
kindly offered their advice, but eventually we found our own way off, across the 
fields and into the country.&nbsp; We were buzzing now, or was it the power lines 
above us, and we continued buzzing through Trysull, past the church and its 
other quaint buildings.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">Amazingly we stopped 
for breakfast at 10.10am in the shadow of an England flag at Seisdon.&nbsp; A sign to 
Kinver prompted the discussion about a possible walk along Kinver Edge next 
year. &nbsp;JayN’s suggestion was acknowledged by Yup who made a note in his diary.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">Down the 
Staffordshire Way and heading south to Smestow, 2 bangs took us by surprise.&nbsp; 
JayN spotted a tree trunk, reminding him of ‘The Thing’ a 1960’s fictional film, 
and instantly inherited a possible new nick name.&nbsp; After a short stint down the 
Monarch Way to Swindon we pulled in at The Old Bush about an hour ahead of 
schedule.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">Eager to check out 
the hand pull we were dismayed to find the ‘Hobgoblin’ had only just been put on 
and hadn’t settled, so we had no alternative but to try the Banks’s Original or 
Bitter.&nbsp; The first black mark for Mark Steffan who had pieced the walk together 
so well and at such short notice and had included a listing of the number of 
hand pulls at each pub.&nbsp; As we discovered later, it would have been of more 
benefit if we’d got the number of handpulls that were actually in use… but who’s 
complaining?</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">The charming gent 
waiting on, who had come in specially to assist, was a jovial sort and he took 
the ‘home-made’ food orders efficiently as we necked a couple of pints of 
Banks’s.&nbsp; It appeared that the food was prepared too quickly for some as 
Tottering Tone made his way to the dining area.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">Jay Cee, Tiny Tims 
and Josephee’s meals were the last to be dished out.&nbsp; The waiter apologised for 
the delays as they were waiting for the pastry crust to brown on the pies.&nbsp; This 
was difficult to swallow for JayCee as he’d ordered Cajun Chicken!!&nbsp; Not 
deterred they also plumbed for the puddings after whilst the rest waited and 
supped another half.&nbsp; Joe’s only teeny weeny criticism if he had to give one, 
was the shortage of custard on his pud.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">Yup had suggested 
that puddings be ordered at the next pub but it was too late, Jacko had been too 
eager and had not only ended up burning his tongue but had ended up with spotted 
dick.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">Next on the itinery 
was the Old Bull.&nbsp; Markus Stephano had noted that it had got 3 hand-pulls, and 
so without hesitation Mid-week Tone ran up to the entrance without a totter and 
beckoned everyone in.&nbsp; Alas….no other customers, and no cask ales what so 
ever…aahhhh. &nbsp;The empty car park should have given it away.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">Heads dropped, but 
we set off again knowing that the Crooked House would surely be on fine fettle.&nbsp; 
If only we could find it!!&nbsp; We followed the old railway cutting down to Oakfarm 
and past the clay pit.&nbsp; It should be here somewhere!!!&nbsp; Up and past the landfill 
site and the rubbish strewn amongst the verges and hedgerows we arrived at a 
junction on the Dudley Road; and a large sign indicating the presence of the 
Crooked House.&nbsp; But in which direction?? Spikelett rang the pub and confirmed 
we’d missed the turn back down the lane.&nbsp; Never, what an approach to the pub!!&nbsp; 
Finally we’d found it.&nbsp; Giblett’s knees were knackered and he was glad of the 
rest.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">A din of garage 
music welcomed us as we approached the pub, blasting out from the cockpit of a 
souped up astra parked next to the entrance. &nbsp;The young lads were enjoying their 
selves though and knocking back the cider without a care in the world.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">The crooked house is 
a remarkable building with only the grandfather clock apparently being the only 
item that’s vertical.&nbsp; It’s history was read out by Josephee but Zolette took 
over as we were all dropping off.&nbsp; The tale of a ghost putting the willies up 
customers near the ladies toilets drew gasps from some quarters.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">Demonstrations of 
the defiance of gravity took place in the bar using the golf balls found in the 
golf course we’d crossed earlier.&nbsp; The specific gravity of the ales however 
remained the same as the Old Bush…Banks’s original and Bitter…..No guest 
beers!!!&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">So it was time to 
move on.&nbsp; JayN was eager to miss out on the highlight, Himley Hall and the 
lakes, as he was on a promise at 7pm, but was unfortunately persuaded to hang on 
with the rest and check it out.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">Before we could set 
off we just had to wait for JayCee who had just ordered more beer.&nbsp; What’s more, 
he’d paid for it but the barrel had now got to be changed.&nbsp; Still, he proved 
he’s not a wimp by downing his pint in barely 10 minutes or so.&nbsp; We left the 
same way as we’d arrived, back up the lane past the landfill site.&nbsp; If only we’d 
listened to Jacko who had still got his bearings.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">We soon entered the 
country park and passed its cress beds and bmx scrambling areas, lakes and Hall, 
before dropping in to the Dudley’s Arms for half an hour before being picked up 
by Nat Sav Darren.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">In the minibus Pedro 
sat at the front cus he was last out of the Dudleys Arms.&nbsp; Luckily he didn’t 
have to endure the Bobby Moore story on the tv screen, but instead had to listen 
to Darren, the no 1 footy fan, who gave him the history of footy back to the 
1960’s. &nbsp;Pedro was heard to say he didn’t do football.&nbsp; JayCee shouted that the 
balls are round but he feigned deafness as he usually does when he hears the 
word ‘round’ and quickly went into Peter Kay mode, asking ‘Bin busy?’ and ‘what 
time yer on till?’, and pointing out the chevrons on the roundabouts.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">There were one or 
two tired Keiths, nodding on the second row, but they had been up earlier than 
most.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">A very pleasant day 
out and yet again we were blessed with good weather.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">Here’s to Stafford 
Castle at Christmas and some decent ale</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">Regards</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">Yupmeister</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
