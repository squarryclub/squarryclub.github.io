<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">Staying at the Old 
Plough, Braunston in Rutland (01572 722714) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B&amp;B �30/head/night</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">Up for it were 
Spikelet, Yup, Mr Tahoohigh, Dan the man, JayCee, Jacko, Tiger Tim, Chris

<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">Them woz the days 
when we used to slip off in a small group, pick an area on a map and make up the 
walk as we went along and eventually stop off somewhere for a well earned pint 
when we�d finished.&nbsp; Not any more, now we�re into organised push-bike rides with 
refreshment stops, brewery trips, curry night outs, and b&amp;b�s.&nbsp; Whatever next?</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">During the 
organisation of this one I must point out that I asked Mr Tahoohigh if he�d 
sorted out sleeping arrangements, but he wonner interested.&nbsp; �More fun not 
knowing eh�.&nbsp; He was right of course, just ask Jacko and Mid week Tone!</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">So, come 12 noon, a 
mass exodus from the offices began with JayCee being picked up along with his 
20cu.m luggage case who was waiting in the service road. &nbsp;He�d packed large tins 
of sun cream and bum cream (for the after-effects of the biking of course) and 
was overloaded.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">The brewery trip had 
been arranged for 3pm so with the driving time to Rutland being less than 2 
hours, and a noon start, there was just time to check out a Camra guide listed 
pub, The Harboro Hotel at Melton Mowbray on route.&nbsp; Keithee and Jacko were 
flashed and readily agreed to stop off for a swift�un</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">The hiring of bikes 
had been arranged from some hire shop near Rutland Water.&nbsp; As it happened, it 
wasn�t the one we turned up at on the day, but that�s neither here or there.&nbsp; 
Tiger Tim took his own racer and 2 other three-wheelers were taken; which were 
fixed to the rear end of Mid-week Tones car.&nbsp; A number plate was of course 
fastened around them to ensure compliance with the regulation changes made back 
in 1972, which Pedro reminded us of.&nbsp; This was reassuring until he happened to 
notice it was the wrong colour!!&nbsp; Luckily, he changed the subject when an array 
of flashing chevrons beamed out around the bends near Melton.&nbsp; He was in ecstacy.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">Directions were 
obtained from Hayley, adorned with tattoos and studs and a pram, who we held up 
on a pelican crossing she was attempting to cross.&nbsp; Good old Hayley.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">Most had arrived in 
sufficient time to sample a pint at the digs before the short leg to the 
brewery.&nbsp; The �cooking� ale was on tap; one of the ales we would be sampling 
again no doubt at the brewery.&nbsp; Spike was due to arrive at 6ish and Chris J was 
due the next morning for the walk only.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">Arriving at the 
digs, suitably refreshed, we had 5 minutes of throwing our gear into the rooms 
before being picked up by the taxis.&nbsp; Our female driver, who was from Rhodesia 
incidentally, confirmed that Mr Tahoohigh had been fibbing about the lack of 
Indian restaurants and that there was only a Chinese restaurant in Oakham.&nbsp; He 
hadn�t anticipated the resolve of Yup who was on the case.&nbsp; There were in fact 
several Indians, Italians and others within the local area !!&nbsp; As we made our 
way to the brewery Pedro lectured us on the advantages of correctly engaging 
one�s seat belts.&nbsp; Belt up Pedro.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">�Springtime� was 
slurped on arrival at the Grainstore brewery before a video and the tour.&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">Roland was our 
guide, the master brewers and second in command being unavailable.&nbsp; JayCee 
wandered around carrying his half-finished pint that he had brought from the 
digs.&nbsp; A selection of bulbs in a tub were spotted, presumably for making the 
lighter ales??&nbsp; Dashing asked when the dash went in the mash and whether the 
splash went before the dash?&nbsp; Get real !!</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">At the end of the 
tour, several jugs of different ales were poured for us as we sat in a group at 
the end of the bar mulling over the varied tastes and flavours.&nbsp; Pedro stayed on 
the �black panther� mild which proved to be the weakest beer on tap.&nbsp; Nipples 
were on hand and available to anyone who wanted a taste of the real stuff the 
following day.&nbsp; JayCee however, so excited over his nipples, had jumped the gun 
and opted for his free pint straight away.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">The hunger pangs 
were beginning to gnaw away so Dasher requested more monkey nuts to keep us 
going.&nbsp; It just gave us enough energy to take our first stroll around the town 
where we located the Indian and pre booked it for the following night.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">Back near the 
station we took taxis back to the digs, excitingly looking forward to exploring 
the rooms, and more particularly the bed arrangements.&nbsp; Four, it appeared, had 
single beds in the 1050 room; Keithee, Spikee, Stubbee and Dashing.&nbsp; Pedro, 
JayCee and Yup were in 3 singles in the Panther room on the ground floor.&nbsp; 
Sounds like Big Brother this.&nbsp; Jacko was in the diary room, or should that have 
been Yup who was busy taking notes again.&nbsp; Tone and Tim were in the same room, 
but with only a double bed to share decided they�d have to sleep top to tail.&nbsp; 
Jacko had opted to sleep separately from Keithee to get some zzzzzz�s but then 
realised he could be sharing a double with Granpop Bill.&nbsp; Bill said he could 
take the rough with the smooth but eventually a �Z� bed was found for Jacko 
which he erected in Tiger Tim and Mid-week Tones room, the beast. &nbsp;Incidentally, 
Joe and Danny shared a double room.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">After the excitement 
had died down we strolled down to The Blue Ball, where Steamy Billee�s ale was 
available.&nbsp; Pedro rang home on someone else�s phone yet again!&nbsp; He�d put a fiver 
credit on his mobile but had forgotten to bring it !&nbsp; derrrr.&nbsp; Sitting on the 
decking in the garden Mid-week Tone�s nipple was raffled off, as the following 
day he was going home directly after the walk and would miss a return to the 
Grainstore.&nbsp; The bidding was furious; beginning at 52p, then raised to 60p, then 
61p by JayCee.&nbsp; Pedro raised the stakes even higher to a �1 declaring that he 
would donate his bid to his favourite charity if he won.&nbsp; In came JayCee again 
with �1.20 followed by a �1.30 offer from Stubbee, then �1.35.&nbsp; Again JayCee 
raised the anti but eventually the hammer came down on Pedro with �2.&nbsp; The air 
was filled with relief, trumpeted around in 5.1 Dolby surround, and all caught 
on the cctv cameras strategically aimed in our direction.&nbsp; Strangely enough, 
there was no-one else was outside except for the house martins and bats which 
had caught a whiff and had fallen to the floor!!</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">Off the catwalk and 
back to the digs, Pedro ordered up the largest cheese and bread board ever 
seen.&nbsp; What a delightful end to the day.&nbsp; Well done Pedro and cheers!&nbsp; How well 
it went down with the whisky chasers�mm�..mm.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">Time for bed and 
much needed snoozes before the big ride tomorrow.&nbsp; We switched the lights off 
but were immediately surrounded by a bright fluorescent glow emitting from 
Pedros bright yellow glass case, outshone only by the bright pink flowers on his 
flowery pyjamas.&nbsp; This was only bettered marginally when JayCee dropped his kegs 
to reveal a pair of long johns which were even longer than his kegs, complete 
with turn ups and creases ���.how could it be??</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">JayCee had neatly 
piled his coins up Scrooge-like.&nbsp; Tremors throughout the night tumbled it to the 
floor on many occasions, or so he was informed by Pedro, but on each occasion 
JayCee would rebuild his little Pisa and become more and more paranoid about the 
tremors.&nbsp; Jacko had thrown his wallet and valuables against the bedroom wall but 
missed and unwittingly threw them out of the window.&nbsp; Lucky for him it was so 
light it had floated back in the breeze and landed on the ledge</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">After finally 
getting to sleep, we were woken by the loudest rasper ever heard from Pedro, 
displacing the slats in Jacko�s bed upstairs.&nbsp; An alarm call 6 hours too early.&nbsp; 
Morning finally arrived and according to Keithee who was absolutely amazed, 
Spike had let off the longest rasper ever heard on the planet.&nbsp; Amazingly, it 
had gone on and on for hours.&nbsp; But was it louder than Pedro�s!!&nbsp; A competition 
may be on the cards.&nbsp; To the rest they were just glad the synchronised snoring 
from Spike and Keithee had ended.&nbsp; During the night, Jacko�s bed had collapsed 
several times.&nbsp; The tremors had blown the slats out of his bed and he�d ended up 
on the floor again.&nbsp; The after shocks continued as a rutland soider ran over 
Danny�s back and Joe had leapt out of the room in search of a man.&nbsp; It also blew 
JayCee�s coins over.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">Spike fresh from his 
slumber, came looking for a hair brush but was out of luck as the only mates 
available were baldies JayCee and Pedro.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">At breakfast Joe, 
was reluctant to ask for another dab of brown, following his experience with the 
rutland spider.&nbsp; The brown sauce bottle eventually found it�s way up to him 
however.&nbsp; Spike finally turned up for breakfast after prising on his new pair of 
cycling pantees and then trying to flatten his hair into place.&nbsp; He hadn�t 
bargained on the static effect his pantees were creating.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">The taxis turned up 
just as Chris �Flash� Jackson arrived after completing his paper round.&nbsp; The 
lengths some folks go to to supplement the council pittance.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">At the bike shop it 
was revealed that Joseph had negotiated the hiring with the wrong shop, but all 
turned out well eventually.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">The bikes were 
tested around the car park before the obligatory photo shoot and we set off, 
gently at first, and gratefully over tarmac footpaths, as we all got used to the 
saddles.&nbsp; Stubbees saddle became twisted but he gritted his teeth like he always 
does and bore the brunt for most of the circuit.&nbsp; After 10 miles he was enjoying 
it but didn�t let on.&nbsp; Bill, almost back to his usual state of unfitness, 
couldn�t get used to getting his leg over.&nbsp; The thrill of it when you�ve been on 
your back for 6 months!! </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">After a long pull up 
to the Finches Arms and a long wait to get served, we sat basking in the 
sunshine in the beer garden admiring the views and enjoying our first pint of 
the day.&nbsp; Chris Flash J had gone awol, cycling a further 5 miles around the 
peninsular to get a sweat on.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">The free wheeling 
back down the hill from the Finches was welcomed.&nbsp; Being used to a motorbike, 
Pedro finally discovered how to change the gears on his bike.&nbsp; At Egleton, Jacko 
took the lead and opted for a stint of bird watching.&nbsp; Sadly it was the 
feathered variety and we were told we were on the wrong track.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">After another steep 
pull, the temptation to stop and sample a pint at the Horse and Jockey proved 
too great.&nbsp; The bikes were readily abandoned and 13 John Waynes settled down at 
the front of the pub.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">The race was then on 
to return the bikes back within the allotted 4 hours to avoid a penalty and then 
up to the Wheatsheaf at Edith Weston for lunch.&nbsp; Ordering was a doddle unless 
your name was JayCee, who had difficulty getting served despite being the first 
to arrive.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">After lunch several 
opted to return to the hotel for a shower and to watch a world cup game, taking 
grateful advantage of lifts offered by Dan the man and Mid week Tone.&nbsp; The 
remaining �never say die� squad walked back.&nbsp; In the lounge the die hards 
arrived totally dehydrated.&nbsp; Keithee downed 3 pints of squash before he had the 
energy to acknowledge anyone.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">The evening began 
with a further visit to the Grainstore where we brandished our nipples, before 
strolling down to the Indian.&nbsp; We were shown upstairs to a long table where it 
didn�t take long for Spike to find a window seat overlooking the street below.&nbsp; 
2 minutes later he was prising open the sash windows and sat in the breeze 
enjoying the views below.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">The food proved to 
be very good and Dasher read out some jokes he�d received on his phone as we 
relaxed afterwards.&nbsp; These were just a couple;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">�Dad, whats the 
difference between a *unt and a vagina�.&nbsp; The dad lifted the boy�s mother�s

<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">As we left Pedro 
squashed a couple of after eight mints into his bright yellow glass case to take 
home as a treat for Joan.&nbsp; Tight bugger.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">We returned for our 
final visit to the Grainstore where Roland chatted to us before getting a rocket 
off a grizzly barmaid.&nbsp; A display of real rockets then lit the sky signalling an 
end to the evening.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">The following 
morning we left after breakfast.&nbsp; Pedro squashed a shower cap and some sugar 
lumps into his glasses case for Joan.&nbsp; She�s a very lucky lady!!</span></p>

<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">Next years venue is 
yet to be decided upon, but whispers of either somewhere near St Peters brewery 
in Suffolk, or Bishop Wells south of Shrewsbury have been heard from Joseph�s

organising this year�s excellent trip so well, including the hottest weather
