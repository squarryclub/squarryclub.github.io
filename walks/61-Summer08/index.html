reaching the B4361 head due west through Haye Park Wood up to High Vindalls.&nbsp; 
Head south to Vallets and The Goggin then due east past The Green, Lower House 
Farm and to the Castle Inn at Richard�s Castle.&nbsp; Cross the B4361 and head south 
parallel to it through Bury and Bilbury onto Orleton and The Boot Inn, where 
local buses can be caught back to Ludlow.&nbsp; An additional section of 3km east to 
The Roebuck at Brimfield wasn�t taken due to unavailability of transport and 
because the pub was shut.</span></em></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><em>
<span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS; font-style: normal">It took some 
indiscrete persuasion this year but Josephee finally got his finger out and 
arranged this year�s summer hike and brewery visit; a couple of nights in 
Ludlow, a brewery visit, and a 10 mile walk in summer sunshine.&nbsp; What could 
possibly go wrong?? .................</span></em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><em>
<span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS; font-style: normal">&nbsp;</span></em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><em>
<span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS; font-style: normal">Well, there could 
be an unfortunate clash with Ludlow�s annual festival and accordingly there 
could be inadequate guest houses available for the second night, and we could be 
split up into several locations around the west midlands; the Tom Tom could be 
playing up; there could be the prospect of staying in haunted hotels with 
druggies and rockers till 2am; there could be issues and disagreements with the 
first guest house regarding misunderstandings over alleged room bookings, and 
the possibility of sharing double beds. There could be no early breakfasts if no 
arrangements had been previously arranged and the walk could be delayed. The 
lunchtime pub on the walk may not have received the food order, 2 out of 3 pubs 
could be shut, only a school bus could be running from the last pub, and Pedro 
could end up with sore testicles!</span></em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><em>
<span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS; font-style: normal">&nbsp;</span></em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><em>
<span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS; font-style: normal">Had this have been 
another episode of the �Apprentice� Mr Tahoohigh could have been fired on the 
first day.&nbsp; However, on the plus side, there were so many benefits it�s worth 
giving him plenty of opportunities within the next 6 years until he gets it 
right.</span></em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><em>
<span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS; font-style: normal">&nbsp;</span></em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><em>
<span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS; font-style: normal">The Yup Yup 
replaced the failing Tom Tom, the fun in rearranging Stubbee and JayCee�s 
accommodation for the second night was a treat to behold.&nbsp; The brewery trip was 
straight forward down to earth and the brewers were friendly with plenty of free 
beer available.&nbsp; There was even time enough for Dasher to grab 40 winks in the 
sunshine.&nbsp; A superb impromptu meal was arranged with a locally recognised chef 
for �6 a head later the same day; the walk was a perfect length for the aging 
amongst us; the weather was superb; the lunchtime stop was perfect; the curry 
was probably the best ever; the company was the best, as always, and the pole 
dance on the bus was not to be missed. </span></em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><em>
<span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS; font-style: normal">&nbsp;</span></em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><em>
<span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS; font-style: normal">So ... marks out of 
ten ....... a whopping 9� out of ten, (but could try harder), and who knows, 
with just another 6 years before he retires, there�ll be plenty more chances for 
him to try again.</span></em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><em>
<span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS; font-style: normal">&nbsp;</span></em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><em>
<span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS; font-style: normal">Well, let�s start 
at the beginning, always a good place.</span></em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><em>
<span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS; font-style: normal">&nbsp;</span></em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><em>
<span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS; font-style: normal">Thanks to Dasher, a 
group of us were driven down to Ludlow in his luxurious 8 seater with perfectly 
working parcel shelves. The M6 was chosen as the most direct route and before 
too long we were entering the confusing traffic system on the outskirts of 
Kidderminster.&nbsp; Dasher�s Tom Tom was playing up but we had the substitute Yup 
Yup to guide us through. Unfortunately, the settings had been set for retail 
parks and several trips around B&amp;Q�s and Focus�s added to the entertainment 
factor.&nbsp; As it wasn�t discount day for retired folks it was of no value to 
Pedro. Exiting from the third trip around Pizza Hut, Mo suggested we had some 
lubrication.&nbsp; JayCee slid his weight over onto his other numb cheek and declined 
the offer.&nbsp; Pedro was ready for a swift one though, admitting that now he�s 
retired, his beard ensures he catches all the drips and gets best value for 
money. �The pubs are full of em at lunchtimes�, he confirmed, �claiming the 2 
for 1 deals�.</span></em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><em>
<span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS; font-style: normal">&nbsp;</span></em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><em>
<span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS; font-style: normal">With just a handful 
of weekends available, the weekend chosen amazingly coincided with the Ludlow 
festival, and consequently there was virtually no accommodation available on the 
Friday night.&nbsp; Thursday wasn�t to be a problem as we could all fit into one 
guest house, a mile out of town though and run by a psycho from one of 
Hitchcock�s films in a Heath Robinson type of property better placed in a 1930�s 
museum.&nbsp; Just for info, did you know the name &quot;Heath Robinson&quot; is used as 
shorthand for an improbable, rickety machine or contraption barely kept going by 
incessant tinkering. WHR was a cartoonist and illustrator!! </span></em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><em>
<span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS; font-style: normal">&nbsp;</span></em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><em>
<span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS; font-style: normal">As we arrived, the 
cartoonist, Mr W.H. Robinson co-incidentally appeared and dished out the keys to 
the rooms.&nbsp; With the prospect dawning that there was a mix up in the room 
bookings and that some could be sharing double beds, there was a rush to nab the 
keys for the single and twin rooms.&nbsp; �If only you�d said�, uttered WHR 
repeatedly.&nbsp; �Twin rooms, arrrh, if only you�d said�. &nbsp;�Early breakfast ?, arrrh, 
if only you�d said...earliest we can do now is 8am.�&nbsp; �I�m retiring, it�s too 
much stress,� muttered Joe... 5 minutes later Spike rang to confirm he wouldn�t 
be joining us.&nbsp; It was too much.&nbsp; Joe popped his head into the oven.</span></em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><em>
<span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS; font-style: normal">We soon dropped our 
gear and grouped outside ready for the mile walk to the brewery.&nbsp; Someone was 
missing. &nbsp;No, it wasn�t Joe. We�d managed to pull him out of the oven.&nbsp; A ground 
floor window opened and Mo�s smiling face appeared with a cuppa in his hand and 
a box of chocolates. </span></em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><em>
<span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS; font-style: normal">&nbsp;</span></em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><em>
<span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS; font-style: normal">The Ludlow brewery 
was easy to find, having already been discovered earlier when the Yup-Yup was in 
action. Mine hosts duly opened up a barrel of Ludlow Gold and explained their 
brewing technique. The origin of the naming of the �Boiling Well� brew was also 
uncovered.&nbsp; The presentation was admirably given and much appreciated by all.&nbsp; A 
litre of lemonade came out to assist the ailing Dasher which he appreciated even 
more.&nbsp; A friend of mine host, who owned a nearby restaurant, the Ringway 
restaurant and wine bar, was coincidently present, and bartering began for a 
bargain early evening meal.</span></em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><em>
<span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS; font-style: normal">&nbsp;</span></em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><em>
<span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS; font-style: normal">With time to spare 
we were recommended sever</span></em><em><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS; font-style: normal">al 
drinking establishments in town worth checking out before we dined.&nbsp; The Bull 
Hotel, where JayCee had been allocated a room for the second night, was 
definitely not recommended, adding weight to JayCee�s resolve to find an 
alternative destination.&nbsp; With the thoughts of jazz music until 2am, rockers, 
drugs, and headless ghosts wandering around his bed in the middle of the night 
he began to consider the prospect of a night in Dasher�s van.&nbsp; The willies were 
well and truly put up JayCee when the proprietor of the Bull agreed with his 
expectations, but thanks to his assistance he found him (and Stubmeister) a room 
at the Rose and Crown next to the church.</span></em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><em>
<span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS; font-style: normal">&nbsp;</span></em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><em>
<span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS; font-style: normal">With the deed done 
the first recommended pub was the Bull ring tavern which we soon discovered had 
run out of ale except for Hobson�s Choice of Hobson�s Choice, and had a rough 
back yard overlooking a building site. Better was to come though as we bypassed 
the Church Inn, saving it�s reputed rating until later, and headed down under 
the arched gateway, over the river and up to the <a name="OLE_LINK1">Charlton 
Arms </a>Hotel overlooking the river.</span></em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><em>
<span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS; font-style: normal">&nbsp;</span></em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><em>
<span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS; font-style: normal">Life couldn�t get 
much better, with views from the roof top terrace and armed with Wye Brew�s 
Butty Bach, or could it?&nbsp; It was time for the prearranged gammon, egg, fresh 
pineapple and veg at an agreed price of �6 a head. What a feast, and served up 
by the owners partner complete with a pacemaker.</span></em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><em>
<span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS; font-style: normal">&nbsp;</span></em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><em>
<span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS; font-style: normal">After struggling to 
stand we set off to find the Nelson for the evening, as recommended by the 
brewery; a useful 5 mile warm up for the following day�s walk.&nbsp; Not exactly what 
we had in mind, following the glowing references, but Mo reminded me there was a 
stunning woman who begrudgingly left as we sat in the ill maintained back yard 
supping St Austell�s tribute.&nbsp; The landlord was eccentric and forgetful, adding 
lemonade to everyone�s ale following Dasher�s request for a dash. &nbsp;With the 
stunning woman gone we faced the decision as to either walk back to the Church 
in town or take a shortcut down the A49 to the digs.&nbsp; As we were making our 
minds up the head brewer turned up and we agreed it was a fantastic pub !!</span></em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><em>
<span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS; font-style: normal">&nbsp;</span></em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><em>
<span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS; font-style: normal">We returned to the 
Church for a quick�un but called it a night when Mothy�s eyes began to seal up.</span></em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><em>
<span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS; font-style: normal">&nbsp;</span></em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><em>
<span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS; font-style: normal">The following 
morning began with a late breakfast.&nbsp; Mo kindly offered up half of his sausage 
but there were no takers surprisingly.&nbsp; Mo was so impressed with the breakfast 
he gave the lady a box of Roses chocolates. Heath Robinson was called in to sort 
out the bill and after expecting the worst, we resolved the room booking 
confusion and the bill without much of a fight.&nbsp; Parking was at a premium around 
the castle but eventually we landed at the main car park on the opposite side of 
the town and at last met up with Sparklet, Stubmeister and Thingy outside the 
castle entrance, who had arrived earlier that morning.&nbsp; After a couple of mug 
shots we set off around the north side of the castle and headed due west/south 
west to Mary Knoll.&nbsp; The terrain was ideal for a cycle route remarked Joe.&nbsp; 
Graham turned white at the very thought.</span></em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><em>
<span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS; font-style: normal">&nbsp;</span></em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><em>
<span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS; font-style: normal">On to the summit at 
High Vindalls we sat next to the bird hide, admired the views and took in 
refreshments for ten minutes.&nbsp; A further 4km and the first inn stop, the Castle 
Inn at Richard�s Castle, was eagerly anticipated.&nbsp; Lo and behold it was shut and 
heads dropped. Probably as well as were running slightly late !? The pint at the 
Boot Inn would be appreciated more.</span></em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><em>
<span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS; font-style: normal">&nbsp;</span></em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><em>
<span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS; font-style: normal">As we strolled 
along through the recently sprayed fields JayCee�s boots fell apart.&nbsp; Blamed on 
the pesticide we wondered if perhaps it was that they�d only cost �13 from the 
Army and Navy Store.&nbsp; We passed a work force from Stoke who were building a 
tennis court.&nbsp; It was a pleasure to see them sweating so much whilst we were 
taking a leisurely stroll.</span></em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><em>
<span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS; font-style: normal">&nbsp;</span></em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><em>
<span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS; font-style: normal">The Boot Inn 
finally came into sight with a welcoming garden bathed in sunshine. &nbsp;With 
plentiful ale and excellent food and service we kept an eye on the time to 
ensure we wouldn�t miss the bus back to Ludlow.&nbsp; Thingy and Sparky left and 
walked on to The Roebuck at Brimfield to retrieve their car and sped off to see 
a Sultana, and tight Pedro bought a round of halves.</span></em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><em>
<span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS; font-style: normal">&nbsp;</span></em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><em>
<span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS; font-style: normal">The bus stop was 
directly outside the pub.&nbsp; A bus passed at 2.45.&nbsp; Joe and Keithee checked the 
timetable which stated 2.45.&nbsp; It was the wrong timetable!&nbsp; The bus was bang on 
time at 3pm.&nbsp; JayCee found a priority seat for elderly persons and sat down.&nbsp; 
There was a shortage of young ladies on board but the older generation enjoyed 
an inaugural display of pole dancing from the Yup</span></em><em><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS; font-style: normal">meister 
which brightened their otherwise boring day up.&nbsp; </span></em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><em>
<span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS; font-style: normal">A quick look round 
the castle shop in Ludlow we decided to leave the castle tour for another day 
and sought refuge in the courtyard of the Rose and Crown with soft drinks and 
tea !!!!.&nbsp; Mid week Tone, Graham and the Keithees thought better and supped 
Abbotts.&nbsp; �Are you an early riser?� Stubbee asked Jay Cee, as the bells from the 
adjacent church began to toll at the 4 o�clock mark. Silence fell at 5 past, 
when the bell ringer had tolled himself off.&nbsp; Jetsetter Mothy began falling 
asleep again so we opted for an early evening to get ready for Joe�s birthday 
bash later.</span></em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><em>
<span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS; font-style: normal">&nbsp;</span></em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><em>
<span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS; font-style: normal">We met up at the 
Charlton Arms. Joe began very sensibly on orange juice as proved by the CCTV 
camera which watched his every move on the balcony.&nbsp; The Butty Bach proved 
popular again for most.</span></em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><em>
<span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS; font-style: normal">&nbsp;</span></em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><em>
<span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS; font-style: normal">Golden Moments was 
the Indian chosen by Yup who had prebooked a party table.&nbsp; The food and service 
was exceptional with free chats for the Stubbmeister and Pedro following an 
incorrect serving.&nbsp; After the meal a birthday ice cream with candle was 
presented to Mr Tahoohigh and a chorus of �get the drinks in for the lads� 
echoed round the room.&nbsp; If only he could have found his credit card which had 
slipped out of his pocket and into JayCee�s lap, he�d have got one.&nbsp; We still 
had one anyway, with coffees, sambuchas, brandy�s and Captain Morgan�s for 
Dasher, it was a perfect end to the celebrations.</span></em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><em>
<span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS; font-style: normal">&nbsp;</span></em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><em>
<span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS; font-style: normal">As we left the 
young waiter deservedly gained a huge tip and JayCee vowed to have a detox when 
he returned home.&nbsp; Graham, Midweek Tone, Dasher and Pedro wound their way back 
to their digs on the outskirts of the county dragging Graham away from every pub 
they passed.&nbsp; The rest were fortunate to call into the Church Inn for nightcaps, 
several in fact.&nbsp; Keithee admitted to being an eighth welsh. �Nothing wrong with 
that is there?� he asked his imaginary friends sitting either side of him.</span></em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><em>
<span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS; font-style: normal">&nbsp;</span></em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><em>
<span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS; font-style: normal">At midnight-ish, 
Keithee, Jacko and Joe left for their guest house. &nbsp;Joe apparently got up in the 
middle of the night and fell over Keithee�s legs protruding out of the bottom of 
his bed. &nbsp;It is believed Jacko had tried dragging Keithee outside because of his 
snoring but had given up.&nbsp; JayCee and Stubmeister returned next door waiting for 
the bells to wake them up for breakfast.&nbsp; Mo Who and Yup climbed the wooden 
hills and began chatting and breaking wind, as you do.&nbsp; Mo slipped to the 
ensuite and returned 2 secs later to find Yuppers fast asleep and snoring.&nbsp;
</span></em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><em>
<span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS; font-style: normal">&nbsp;</span></em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><em>
<span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS; font-style: normal">The following 
morning the rain began. Oh what joy. There was some confusion, as was expected, 
over the deposits and payments, but once they were dealt with there was time to 
slip back to the brewery to purchase some momentos.</span></em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><em>
<span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS; font-style: normal">&nbsp;</span></em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><em>
<span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS; font-style: normal">As always, it was a 
memorable trip.&nbsp; Many, many thanks go to Josephee for his tireless efforts. We 
wish him well for the next 6 years or so and look forward to the next summer 
brewery trip.</span></em></p>
