<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">Advanced
arrangements were eventually made and put together by Keithus.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>At one point an army of around 17 were expected to descend on the Woe.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>However, the Roaman army reduced to 9 as the trip neared which was more
than enough to subsequently drink the village of Haltwhistle dry of its Irish
whiskey.<o:p>

</o:p>
</span><!--mstheme--></font></h1>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">Advanced
parties, group 1 and 2 went all out for the full 4 days with group 3 arriving as
�reinforcements� on the Friday morning.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Battle commenced as groups 1 and 2 made their way up the M6 in 2
chariots, keeping a full 2 chevrons apart of course.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Beardieus failed to appreciate the soothing battle songs of
Christie Moore or the monologues from Bernard Wrigley, a local bullfrog from
Bolton, so we slipped into the site of a motorway services area at Junction 38.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The site was positioned alongside a lake and immediately Beardieus moved
into pole position, literally, and all memories of those haunting melodies
(don�t forget your shovel if you want to go to work; digging; and ordinary
man), melted into the distant past.&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">Group
2 arrived at the Heart of Britain Hotel at Haltwhistle, 2 minutes behind group 1
who were being shown around the rooms.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Just
a 3� hour trip including a break, not bad.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Beardieus claimed the cottage with the Jacuzzi above the laundrette.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">A
quick search around the town exposed its lack of hostelries and clubs, although
a sign in a shop window displayed the opening date of a lap dance club in May.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Every move was being watched through CCTV cameras and the local plods
sitting in their mariahs.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>All we could find was an Indian takeaway, a chippie, a
working- men�s club and a pub closed for refurbishment works.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>One pub stood out though, the Black Bull, with real ale and
excellent food, oh and Jackie, the landlady.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>A delightful railway station sat at the bottom end of the town, complete
with a curved signal box and fancy bridge.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span><img border="0" src="https://baltibugle.co.uk/walks/Silence of the lambs/P4240022.JPG" width="336" height="253"></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">After
a quick gander at the timetable, we decided to give Hexham a whirl, just 20 mins
away, on trains that proved to arrive bang on time.&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">Hexham
is a delightful market town with an abundance of Indians, thankfully, and other
restaurants and pubs, oh and a few nice buildings such as the Abbey and castle
on the hilltop, neither of which Wetherspoons had yet managed to get hold of.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Just around the corner though, they had succeeded in converting an old
cinema, so we slipped in for the matinee, a flesh parade, definitely not for
children�s viewing before dining at the recommended �Diwan e am� tandoori
restaurant.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>The choice was overwhelming but we survived.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>(Approx cost �18 including a couple of kingfishers.)<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;"><img border="0" src="https://baltibugle.co.uk/walks/Silence of the lambs/P4240023.JPG" width="280" height="209"></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">The
last train back gave us just enough time to pop into the Black Bull for a
nightcap, before finding our digs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Surprise,
surprise, a wine box emerged back at our digs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<h1><!--mstheme--><font face="Book Antiqua, Times New Roman, Times" color="#660000"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">Friday<o:p>
</o:p>
</span><!--mstheme--></font></h1>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">A few
hours kip and the bin men woke Beardieus up bright and early.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>The remaining centurions arrived just after we had slouched
away from the breakfast room in the main house.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>A �feck� good breakfast� it was too.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The march soon began, up dale and down dale, all at 1 in 1 gradients.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Based on Walk no 19 of 22, the walk was estimated to be around 12 miles.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>These walks are available through Jackonus who purchased them at the
Black Bull at a bargain price of �2.50 complete with a plastic wallet.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The distances shown must have been roman miles, cus we later found that
it was nearer 15-16 proper miles.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
wall was way eye pet when we got to it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Beardieus�s
knee length boots, previously worn by a roman terminator, were unforgiving, so
he dropped down a gear to �twice brewed� for a rest and a cup of tea and
waited for our subsequent arrival.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span><img border="0" src="https://baltibugle.co.uk/walks/Silence of the lambs/P4230003.JPG" width="131" height="157"></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">The
walk took us along the wall from �Shield on the wall� to Housesteads roman
fort, south to Crindledykes, past a tandoori oven,</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;<img border="0" src="https://baltibugle.co.uk/walks/Silence of the lambs/P4240021.JPG" width="347" height="259"></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">from
which the romans must have produced the biggest nan breads ever, and on past
Vindolanda, a fort and civilian settlement named after one of their hot leaders,
obviously.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Who said they evolved
from Birmingham?<img border="0" src="https://baltibugle.co.uk/walks/Silence of the lambs/P4240018.JPG" width="164" height="216" align="right"></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">The
pub at �Twice Brewed�, next to �Once Brewed� surprisingly, was most
welcoming.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Beardieus had dropped
into a coma after squeezing every last drop of energy from his aching body but
just had enough strength left to slump into a soft chair.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>A poster displayed a competition to name a beer after the wall.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Hadrian�s Jock Strap and Hadrian�s smooth were amongst many that were
suggested.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">Fully
fortified, we set off for the
final leg across fields and fields of sheep and little lambs. In one
field a dead sheep and 2 lambs crouched within a few yards of it attracted our
humane attention.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Kennus
Humanitarius Spencerus took pity on the lambs and without much ado retraced his
steps back across a couple of fields to a farmhouse to alert the farmer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>A horse in one of the fields took a shine to him until he whispered in
its ears <i>�F off�</i>.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">No-one
in at the farm so he scratched a message, just like in the old roman days,
telling the farmer where he could find the lambs and left his phone number as a
contact.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Out of the corner of his
eye he noticed the farmers wife�s washing, hanging on the line.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>A couple of sniffs unfortunately revealed it was clean, so he began his
trudge back again.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">The
horse pestered him again as he returned until he whispered in its ears <i>�F
off�</i>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;</span><img border="0" src="https://baltibugle.co.uk/walks/Silence of the lambs/P4230011.JPG" width="253" height="192"></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Joe pointed out the sheep dip as Ken returned (small black
dot in the distance) from the farmhouse.<span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;"><o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">Steve
checked out the dead sheep�s body, approaching it from all angles, until
eventually feeling comfortable coming from behind, talking sweet nothings into
its ears and handling it with the skill of<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>a
ventriloquists dummies master.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He
confirmed it was dead.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">With
tears rolling down our faces, we collapsed as the lambs� real mother appeared
and led the 2 lambs away; the dead sheep obviously was a decoy and had been
planted for Steveus Machinus� pleasure only. </span><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">Ewe
phanisms rang out along with a few tunes; Ewe were made for me, Only ewe, It�s
not un ewe sual to be loved by anyone, He�ll never find another ewe.&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">Kennus
Humanitarius Spencerus slinked off attempting a lambada shimmy, muttering �you
can f� this humanitarian lark from now on�.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>For the rest of the walk he was as quiet as a lamb. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">A
dead cat lay abandoned on a shed roof and Kennus Humanitarius Spencerus ignored
it.&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">Ahead
of us, a field of bulls, cows, whatever, stood their ground with the biggest
horns ever seen.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Beardieus admitted
he was a townie lad and had never been in a field before. He was a country
virgin.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Horny would never seem the
same to him again<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">A
quick shower for most, a horny jacuzzi for Beardieus, and we descended to the
Black Bull to avoid the 7.00pm crush.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>An
early start had been recommended to ensure we�d get a table.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Kennus Humanitarius Spencerus turned up late looking a little
sheepish. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">The
blackboard was chokka with a full menu from rabbit pie to chilli and fish.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>No one had the lamb chops.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There
were so many jugs of gravy and dishes of vegetables that we didn�t know where
to put them. &nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">Prince
Bishop and Watchtower were amongst the ales on offer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Beardieus initially had the smoothflow but succumbed to the real taste of
real ale as the night wore on.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As
the evening wore on even more, there were signs of one or two tired warriors
cracking.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Joseph Tuohyus, his
trousers bulging!, began recounting memories of his recent irish trips and began
singing the first line of the wild rover, over and over again, followed by
attempts of<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>the Fields of Athon
Rye.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>After a bold attempt, but
failing miserably, he suggested jammysons all round, which seemed to have a
positive wakening effect on the rest of us.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>One round though and we�d drunk the bottle dry.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Luckily for us, Jackie, the landlady, produced a bottle of Bushmills,
which she said we could either buy for �54, or replace with another bottle the
following day.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>No problem there!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>A bagful of ice was duly provided and Stubbus after untying the knot in
double quick time, offered the ice around while performing a strange Fagin type
act.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>You know you want it, come on
boys, you know�..<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Jackie�s husband appeared none too happy with this arrangement and a
few angry glances were noted.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As
security, and to chear him up, we left a �30 deposit which appeared to quell
his fears.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The bottle re emerged
from under jackus�s seat from time to time until we finally emptied it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Some of us went back to the digs to drink wine, some went to find a room,
some to find a bed and some to find the toilet door.&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">Steveus
Machinus, Kennus Humanitarius Spencerus, Keithus I�m on for itus Rectus and
Johnus Twitcherus set off for the second days full 9 roman mile walk, travelling
anticlockwise through Haltwhistle Burn to the woe, and heading west to meet the
rest of us on the wall near Alloa Lea, who had taken the easy route in the car
up to Greenhead.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Here the woe stops
suddenly at the edge of a modern quarry, which is now a country park.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>We took the easy tarmac pathway up to the woe but went the wrong way.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Who needs a compass?<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">Thirlwall
castle beckoned us as we returned to Greenhead, except Beardie, who bypassed the
ruin and sat waiting for us to finish our inspection.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>A pink or green tailed woodpecker could be heard tapping
nearby.&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">Talking
of tails, Kennus Humanitarius Spencerus, still feeling for yesterdays lambs,
fancied trying out the role of a surrogate mother.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>So, having found a woolly tail he slipped it under the back
end of his cap.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It was so realistic
complete with dried up doings on the end. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">Lunch
was served by Mr Surly at the Greenhead Hotel.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Johnus Twitcherus immediately set to task in true boy scout/blue peter
fashion, constructing a bench in the sun using a plank and supports of ridge
tiles in the sun.&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">The
car group returned to the tandoori oven for another recky, via the offie to
purchase the replacement Bushmills, while the rest walked back to the hotel.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Mr Surly�s brother, Mr Grumpy, kicked us out of the entrance building
at Vindaloo saying it was not a free museum like a tourist information office
and that we had to pay.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Stuff that for a game of soldiers.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">Before
the 3 wise men returned home, Joseph Tuohyus sat in the sun with his eyes closed
sunning himself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Johnus Twitcherus
remarked that he looked nice and relaxed, to which Kennus Humanitarius Spencerus
quipped, �he was relaxed last night,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>as
relaxed as a newt.�&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">Just
a short time later the remaining group returned to Hexham again. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Wetherspoons
lured us into its stalls yet again, the cheapest seats in the house, yet with
the best technicolour views possible.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span><o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">Beginning
to feel hungry, we found an Italian in one of the quaint back streets.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>A little quiet at first, but it soon began buzzing as the wine flowed and
the waitress divulged that she was only 18 years old to Keithus Jackonus.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>His attention turned then to complementing the builder on how well he had
reproduced an Italian style restaurant.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Final
verdict: Great ambience, mediocre food and nice ceiling.&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">Nature
called as we followed the town walls, and bushes, back to the station and
returned to Haltwhistle and our final visit to the Black Bull.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Beardieus got pole position again and pulled the landlady�s
mother in law.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Time to go, way aye
man, pet.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Beardieus felt an arse as
he said his good byes to Jackie.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Keithus
I�m on for itus Rectus had to retrieve his chewing gum from her throat and
Johnus Twitcherus was tongued.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Bye
bye Hadrian, for now, you old brick.&nbsp;<o:p>
