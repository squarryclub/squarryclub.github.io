		lunch was just the remedy for a heavy cold and she would be at the pub

<p class="auto-style14">The minibus set off from the Westbury Tavern at 
7.30 picking up Debbie, Dasher and Benson on the way to meet up with the rest at 
the Chetwynd Arms at Brocton; half the group meeting in the rear car park and 
half meeting at the front door expecting early morning refreshments.&nbsp; Once 
there was a realisation there were no early morning drinkees, Hecky Thump led 
the way at the allotted time of 8.30 across open fields directly into the 
westerly wind, which more than blew the Christmas cobwebs away.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="auto-style14">At one 
point the field ahead was not dissimilar to the fields of the Somme.&nbsp; At 
this point questions were coming from the ranks as to wether the walk could be 
skipped and could a short cut be found to the breakfast stop.&nbsp; Not to be 
put off, Hecky led the group and ploughed on through the mud to the village of Bednall where 
firmer footing was found.</p>
<p class="auto-style14">From here the going got better and the Chase was soon entered.&nbsp; Not 
shortly afterwards the smell of a wood fire and freshly cooked bacon could be 
smelt wafting through the trees.&nbsp; This put a spring in everybodys step, so 
much that the leading group walked straight past the entrance to the cafe.&nbsp; 
Once again the Springslade Lodge Cafe was welcoming with an open fire on the go 
and plenty of bacon and sausage sandwiches to replenish the troops.</p>

<p class="auto-style14">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="auto-style14">All too shortly Hecky Thump decided that we needed to start making our 
		way to the Barley Mow at Milford Common for lunch time drinks</p>
<p class="auto-style14">Once again the elements were faced but knowing that only an hour away 
		was the rest and comfort of the Barley Mow. &nbsp;</p>
<p class="auto-style14">Fortunately the weather held up and the views from across the Chase over 
		Sherbook Valley were well worth the early morning start.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="auto-style14">Even though Mrs Hecky Thump was still in the comfort of her own 
		lounge she still got the blame as Hecky Thump took the wrong path on the 
		way down to Milford Common. </p>
		<p class="auto-style14">There were fears that a steep hill would have to be negotiated, but 
		Hecky Thump knowing the Chase like the back of his hand (allegedly) 
		circuited the hill and fortunately no drinking time was lost. </p>
