<td width="96%" colspan="3"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">For most, the train left Stoke station at 7.24am, arriving in Hatton just before 8. We'd hoped to get groupsavers but sadly we had to cough up the full �8.90 as they weren't available this time.<br>
With only the one carriage we wondered who was driving, or even if there was a driver. The conductor couldn't help us as it was his first day on this train apparently. <br>
Getting the cold shoulder, Mr Tahoohigh realised Pedro�s bottle of 'orange squash' on the storage rack had been leaking. 'I need an umbrella, ella ella', he cried, all the vodka's gone'.<br>
It was a bright sunny start as predicted as we jumped off at Hatton to meet up with the Heavy, Heckies and Knotts at Hatton station, together with Brian and Mark who were joining us for the first time on an office sqwalk.<br>
We didn't walk too far, as the Castle caf� stop was only 200 yards up the main road towards Tutbury. The cafe was quite small but very friendly and efficient. The queue for the toilet out the back delayed the restart with Brian being last out. With a head count underway Joe confirmed at Brian's name 'Ian teer'. Possibly a new nickname??<br>
Fully assembled we headed up towards the castle entrance, where a peacock took a fancy to Heavy. 'Feel the weight of that', he said picking up one of its feathers, 'it's as light as a feather aint it'.<br>
Sadly the castle wasn't open this early in the morning so we gathered for a group shot in front of the wall. 'Bring on the wall'. <br>
GPS became the official photographer for the day snapping to his hearts content whenever he spotted a chance. Check out his banana at the end of these notes.<br>
Tutbury Castle for the historians out there was built in 1061, just a few years before the Norman Conquest of 1066. It's a spectacular castle with a large deep moat, that sits on top of the hill looking over the town. It was also used as a prison to hold Mary Queen of Scots from 1569, who was beheaded on 8th Feb 1587 just two years after leaving the castle. The tower where Mary was held still stands today. <br>
The majority of Tutbury Castle today is in ruins, but it's reasonably well preserved. It is also noted to be one of the most haunted buildings in Britain, hosting none other than the ghost of Mary who has been seen roaming around by many a visitor. </font></td>

A minor domestic could be heard between Austin and Jax over the correct way up and over to the crater. As they'd only walked this stretch the week before, who'd got the best memory and who would be proved right? I can't say, but better luck next time Jax....<br>

The sun was still shining as we approached private land owned by the Duchy of Lancaster. We had a choice of entering the woods or continuing down the lane which would get us to the pub quicker. No contest....<br>
Dasher admitted he was worried, especially as he didn't drink.. He was dreaming of his first pint sitting on the bar waiting for him....... <br>

Despite our excitement of discovering the pulls, there was only Abbott on sadly, so we made do. At least we weren't staying too long today, just long enough however to carry out running repairs to a blistered pair; GPS and Heavy, using Yup's emergency kit.</font></td>

Pedro and Debris munched through their burgers. 'Is yours moist', asked Pedro. 'Yes, and I�ve also had onions which always make me fxxt', came the reply. Quickly the discussions changed to Joseph's walking stick and it's origins.<br>

We wondered out to the local bus shelter to catch the bus back to Tutbury as it started to rain, and all 15 of us squeezed in, keeping the locals at bay.<br>
There was a rush to the wooden platform at Tutbury where B Ed. explained its construction, how it would last around 20 years, and that there had been no station at Hatton until recently. Amazing what you find out on these walks.<br>
Again one train carriage and a hundred thousand of us squeezed on for the short journey back to Stoke, where a few staggered along to Wetherspoons for a final half.</font><p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2"><br>
