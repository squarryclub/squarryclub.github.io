the breakfast stop.

brown one, in the midst of a misty haze, but eventually the clouds lifted 
briefly and Yup�s landmark clearly stood out before us. Thank goodness the 
farmer hadn't ploughed the field next to it.</td>

just a few 
minutes late at Forge Farm Studios in Wootton.&nbsp; We were 
warmly welcomed by Lee and 
Simon who had kindly offered to provide us with a convenient tea and coffee break and the 
opportunity to see their collection of sculptures and paintings.
<p>A 
fine collection of sculptures was on display, although I wasn�t aware of any 
sales transactions taking place on the day.&nbsp; Maybe later?&nbsp; Affording a 
sculpture or a new car was a fine 'balancing act' !!&nbsp; Check out

<p>Benson suddenly appeared out of the blue to join us, having returned home from 
where he'd been waiting in Stoke and then having driven 
directly to us.&nbsp; Sadly we had missed him in Stoke; as he had been waiting outside Maplins 
instead of One Stop.&nbsp; There had been some confusion over the pick up point, 
not sure whether it was Yuppy's error or Bensons, but at least he was now with 
us.&nbsp; One thing is for sure, he would be carrying his phone with him in the 
future.&nbsp;

rewarded before he moved on and pleaded with his next possible provider, Pedro.
