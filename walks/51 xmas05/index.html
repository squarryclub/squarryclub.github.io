<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">Memories of the 
Squarrites 2006 Christmas Walk</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">With the memories 
of Joe�s Summer Walk now a fond but distant memory, talk was now focused on who 
was to take their turn at organising the next Christmas walk. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">Somehow, up until 
this point the Traffic boys, had miraculously remained invisible and 
inconspicuous in squarry event organisation, an almost impossible achievement 
given Granpop Bill�s 10ft frame.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">Not wanting to 
depart from true Council ethos and traditions, why should one person organise 
the work when 3 could do it just as well, Granpop Billee, Stubbee and Captain Shandy Man 
teamed up to organise the Christmas walk to Cheddleton. </span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">With the Route 
issued, minibus &amp; pubs organised, Traffic orders were issued, and on Wed 28<sup>th</sup> 
Dec the red light was given at the start of the walk. Unusually for the Traffic 
section, prior consultation had taken place on the 12 mile route. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">Stevee Morgan had 
mysteriously not turned up for the minibus, however it was later revealed that, 
whilst allegedly cleaning out his gutters, he had taken an unsupported bungee 
jump from his ladder and done his back in.&nbsp; This is slightly more believable 
than JCee�s � falling in the shower� excuse for missing an earlier squarre�.
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">Following 
everybody�s arrival, a minutes silence was duly observed in memory of Emma, 
Steve Willis�s daughter.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">The start of the 
walk commenced spot on 8-00am as intended, err, actually, 5 changes of traffic 
lights later no one had moved, everyone seemed frozen to the spot, content to 
keep the Christmas Spirit alive from the many hip flasks that appeared.&nbsp; </span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">A cunning ploy 
adopted by the traffic boys was to rely on the many natural born orienteering 
and map readers amongst the walkers to take the lead and force the pace. At 
minus three degrees it was clear that this cunning stunt was never going to 
succeed. A good job that Granpop Billee had reconnoitred the week before and 
knew the route, at least until the point where the first path split.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">Not daunted by 
this initial dilemma, Bill then skilfully led the way beyond Big Susans Wood and 
through a farmyard, within a knats c**k of the farmhouse living room window. The 
braver ones (pervs?), glancing surreptitiously to see what the Farmer�s wife was 
up to on this lonely winters morning. (Not a lot as it happened!)</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">Moving like a 
finely honed marching troop, the squarrites passed the Powys Arms and arrived at 
the A520 where Spikee met his spouse, perfectly on time, with a veritable feast 
of oatcakes �n cheese with choices of sausage or bacon, sauces, orange juice and 
a little �snifter� available from a bottle of Grants. (Special thanks go to 
Spikee and his wife for their extraordinary effort and time in preparing the 
food &amp; refreshments). With the tempting smell of food in their nostrils, the 
squarrites moved quicker than a very quick thing through a tunnel formed under 
Rock Cottage where they �dropped their loads� &amp; basked in the warm winter 
sunshine. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">The squarite 
hoards, having quenched their thirst and gorged their �potteries poppadoms� like 
a ravenous pack of hungry hounds, moved on swiftly (particularly as the scented 
aroma of decayed animal flesh hung in the air from the local slaughterhouse) 
across the fields towards Folly Lane &amp; Old Hall Farm and onto the footpath 
signed to Consall Forge.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">Arrival at the 
Black Lion was spot on the programmed ETA (would you expect any less from the 
Traffic Boys?)</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">At this point two 
separate factions developed � the hardened drinkers vs the hardened walkers. The 
drinkers stayed to partake of a few more aperitifs prior to lunch, whilst the 
walkers made their way up the Devils Staircase, where Spike made several stops, 
sweating profusely, his face redder than an irate Rigan Taxi Driver, whilst 
maintaining he was only stopping to take in the scenery.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">At this point the 
realisation that Bill was no longer leading us hit home and sure enough it 
wasn�t long before everyone was gazing skywards, staring at the ground and 
mumbling profanities, blaming the uncertainty of our whereabouts on lack of 
visible landmarks.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">After lengthy 
negotiations Mid week Tone was handled firmly and put in his place by the rather 
attractive young waitress, who had refused to serve only half the party.&nbsp; The 
�walkers� eventually turned up at the The Boat at 2-30ish to the delight of the 
�drinkers�, who had been forced to partake of further ale in the absence of the 
full party.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">Surrounded by 
festive surroundings, the meals were finally served, with mutterings from the 
waitresses about the mountain of rucksacks, sticks, coats and leggings that had 
very quickly formed a slightly smaller version of Hadrian�s wall between the 
restaurant and the toilet facilities. This caused many a snigger and stifled 
amusement as the other guests attempted to make the restaurant to toilet 
pilgrimage, falling more times than horses at the Grand National.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">The onward journey 
by some was back along the towpath and back to Deep Hayes and for others 
carrying on to The Hollybush at Denford. Arrival at the Hollybush was welcomed 
by all; only tainted by the fact that few of the real ales were available. &nbsp;By 
way of consolation the majority of the 10 remaining stalwarts tucked into the 
selection of home made puddings. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">DCeen, whilst 
walking in a dreamlike Christmas stupor, had been fondly reminiscing about the 
former love(s) of his earlier, pre-married life. &nbsp;Almost as though it was 
written in the stars � Dave�s dream came true. Across a distant room in the 
Hollybush their eyes met, their earlier desires re-kindled; or was she just 
after that tenner that Dave owed her from 30 years ago?&nbsp; Probably the latter. 
&nbsp;Her name was Vulva � and after more time re-counting the joys of their youthful 
unrequited love, Dave soon realised that, as the anticipated time of arrival of 
the minibus came and went, he was going to miss the Stoke match!!</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">With this sudden 
realisation sweeping over him, Vulva was hastily kicked into touch as 
contingency plans were rapidly made, followed by many expletives, particularly 
focussed on what DCeen was going to do to the bus driver when he eventually 
arrived.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">The bus did 
eventually arrive 1 hour and 20 minutes late, with the driver apologising 
profusely and explaining that although it was not strictly his fault, he had 
broken down on the return from East Mids airport.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">DCeen did avoid a 
heart attack and did make the match, albeit a few minutes late, as the driver 
made an impromptu stop at the Britannia Stadium and then onto Westbury Park, the 
undisputed centre of the known universe.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">Groupee Stubbee 
Chuckee</span></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">PS The minutes are 
all my own although I reserve the right not to be sued for any possible liable 
or offence that may be incurred (over and above the value of 1 pint) !!</span></p>
