<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Was there 
ever any doubt that we�d cancel this trip due to the weather�<SPAN 
class=GramE>..</SPAN> Nah, not really!! <SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</SPAN>Forecasts had included torrential storms, 
flood warnings, heavy rainfall, thunder and lightening. The possibility of being 
stuck on top of a mountain with metal walking sticks in lightening storms came 
to mind, and belated consideration was given by some (ergh, ergh) to staying in 
a comfortable guest house instead of a damp tent.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>But Keithee held firm and declared on 
the Wednesday that the walk with overnight camping would go ahead as planned. 
The challenge of the 3 pies of <st1:place w:st="on">Yorkshire</st1:place> was 
very much alive.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>And with Yuppy 
with us, an oasis of sunshine would surely follow us.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>(And guess <SPAN class=GramE>what 
!!!)</SPAN><o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN 
style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Keithee and 
Pedro had set off as the advanced party on the Thursday afternoon.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>The journey should have been straight 
forward; however the monsoon conditions were causing aquaplaning at 50 miles per 
hour so it took a bit longer than anticipated. <SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</SPAN>Upon arrival the rain had subsided to 
mild monsoon conditions and as it appeared to have set in for the duration they 
decided to pitch the tent and to hell with it. <SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</SPAN>It took the experienced campers just 
seconds to throw the tent up and make it habitable (yea really!). That done, the 
rain stopped and Pedro appeared with a bottle of red wine, mmm red wine, and a 
couple of genuine plastic camping wine glasses. <SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</SPAN>This was the beginning of being sensible 
and not having too much to drink on the eve of the walk.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN 
style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">It wasn�t 
long before the rest of the gang arrived and pitched their tents, before making 
their way to the Golden Lion������. except, that is, for Yup, Stub and Mid week 
Tone who were still on the motorway.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
</SPAN>What could possibly have gone wrong? ���..<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN><o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN 
style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Well, there 
was just a minor problem with horrendous tailbacks on the motorway, even before 
an accident occurred which was witnessed by Flash.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>He had quickly changed into his �Flash� 
gear and flew straight to the rescue of a driver whose car had flipped over, 
before continuing up to his parent�s house in Clitheroe in civilian 
clothes.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>The motorway was later 
closed.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN><o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN 
style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Much more 
seriously though for the lads in the yupmobile was the realisation that Stubbie 
had forgotten a 4 pint bottle of milk. Oh what a crisis! How were we going to 
eat dry sugar puffs the following morning?<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
</SPAN><o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN 
style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Worse 
followed��. Mrs Yup rang to confirm she�d found tent poles lying on the garage 
floor�. Oops.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Could this have been 
the chance Yup was looking for to book into a warm and cosy guest house for the 
night instead of lying on a damp patch of grass in a farmer�s field? Was it 
deliberate? Shrouded in guilt however, he used his initiative, and a minor 
detour to purchase a cheap 2 man tent saved his bacon.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Finding a cow to replace Stubbie�s milk 
however proved slightly more difficult.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN 
style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">When they 
finally arrived, the midges on the camp site were biting like fury, so the tents 
were set up at breakneck speed before joining the earlier arrivals in the Golden 
Lion which was quite conveniently situated next to the site.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>The guard dog�s bark frightened the 
living daylights out of them mind, as they slipped by the farmer�s house and up 
the drive to the pub. They were ready for a pint to settle their nerves. 
<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN 
style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">The earlier 
arrivals were settled in the back room of the pub, perched on hard, spring-<SPAN 
class=GramE>less</SPAN> seats, and were surrounded by hundreds of blow 
torches!<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Perhaps the winters are 
dreadful?<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Most were taking it easy 
on the drink front, and restricting their intake to just a couple of pints or 
three.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Pedro and Keithee were the 
exception to the rule though, having earlier necked that bottle of <st1:City 
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Shiraz</st1:place></st1:City>, and were now seen 
slipping down their umpteenth pint of ale. Noticeably, only two were on lager, 
one of whom was christened Sir Stew; or was it Stir Fry, I 
forget.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN 
style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Yup 
reminisced over the last time he had tortured himself in completing the 3 peaks 
walk and his recollection of the size of Pen y Gent.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>On arriving tonight he recalled feeling 
that either Pen y gent appeared bigger, or else he�d shrunk.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>�Oh no you haven�t�, came the chorus of 
replies.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN 
style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">The missing 
poles tale slowly emerged with Yup dishonestly explaining that all was well now 
with his tent, as he�d nicked a pole off every other dishevelled looking tent in 
the field.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN 
style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Flash�s 
anticipated appearance tomorrow was mentioned and his claim to fame in the 
Guinness book of records for his feats of strength came to light. Scottee wasn�t 
that impressed and said he had a friend who was also in the book of records for 
slicing cucumber!<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN 
style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">The barmaid 
was an asset according to Spikelet; and we agreed whole heartedly. After a few 
pints of Timothy Taylor�s Landlord we agreed even more whole heartedly. The last 
orders for food were taken at 9pm.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
</SPAN>�Well done� steaks were the favourite orders taken but they were served 
incinerated on the outside and pink in the middle.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Steve was not impressed and turned to 
his half pint of lager but struggled to finish that too.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>At least we whole heartedly agreed that 
the barmaid was an asset. <o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN 
style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">An early 
night was necessary so we slipped back to the camp site and our damp sleeping 
bags to set our alarms for 5.30am.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
</SPAN>Several loud bangs were heard from Yup�s new tent.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>�Was that the sugar puffs exploding?�, 
Stubbie shouted from the adjacent tent, as Tony attempted to stop further 
buttons from popping off his blow up <S>doll</S> mattress.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN 
style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Flash and 
Hecky Thump arrived bright and early the following morning. Flash, fresh from 
his parent�s house in nearby Clitheroe; and Hecky Thump after an early start 
from Hednesford.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
</SPAN><o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN 
style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Milk 
miraculously appeared for the sugar puffs and all was well, until the smell of 
bacon wafted over from Scottee�s frying pan.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN 
style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">We were 
almost ready for the 7am start but time drifted and after pushing the 
registration details of the group through the door of the post office we set off 
up Pen y gent nearer 7.30.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
</SPAN><o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN 
style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">As we 
neared the first summit Pedro, suffering vertigo, clung tightly to the rocks and 
never looked down. <SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</SPAN>He was not on 
his own.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Yup had got his first pie 
out to begin the 3 pie challenge.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
</SPAN>One pie down, 2 more to go.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN 
style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Flash, with 
2 apples and no water provisions, along with Heavy Steve Machine, with a stone 
in his shoe, could be seen disappearing off into the distance to complete the 
distance in record time.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>If only 
Steve had had enough time to stop and remove the stone from his 
shoe!<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN 
style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">The boggy 
stretch across the next valley bore plenty of evidence of the previous bad 
weather.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Maybe the weather had also 
realigned the pathways because at one stage there was some slight confusion over 
the route.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Scottee accused the 
Ordnance Survey of producing inaccurate maps.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN 
style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">A large 
crevasse proved worthy of a minor 20 yard detour off the path complete with a 
waterfall disappearing into the fissures below.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Mid week Tone and Keithee who had 
slipped ahead at this point opted to conserve their energy and wait for the 
photographs.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN 
style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">The viaduct 
eventually came into view, followed by the welcoming site of the infamous 
�powdered tea� van nestled at the side of the road.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Tea and water rations were taken on 
board as we took our first rest by the stream. <SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</SPAN>The proprietor confirmed to Spike that 
he�d been doing same job for 17 years and that whenever anyone asks him how long 
to the next train, his response was always half an hour. Very helpful!<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>And wouldn�t you have thought that after 
17 years he�d have bought a bin for the rubbish instead of a carrier bag hanging 
off the door?<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN 
style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">It was a 
long pull up Whernside, with Yup and Spike opting to enjoy the views and admire 
the civil engineering feats, including the aqueduct passing over the railway 
route.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>The rest made their way up 
to the summit taking bets on whether Yup and Spike would make the complete 
route.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>There was never a doubt. 
<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</SPAN>2/3 pie was soon achieved, followed 
by a break in the pub, the <st1:place w:st="on">Inn</st1:place> on the Hill, 
with a delightful barmaid.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN 
style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Towards the 
third peak the gang of seven, realising now that Yup and Spike were safely at 
the pub, decided to make a bid for the 12 hour challenge.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Heads down they scaled the last 
peak.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>The view from the top was 
awesome with clear views of the surrounding storm fronts.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>The long trudge from Ingleborough<SPAN 
style="COLOR: red"> </SPAN>back to Horton nearly took another victim in Mid-week 
Tone with stomach cramps.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>A pie 
might have helped?<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Still, he 
soldiered on, and with the assistance of Pedro made it to the end within the 12 
hours.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Stir Fry was suffering with 
sore feet, after not doing any walking for 12 months, but pushed to cross the 
line along with Keithee, Scottee, Windy Stubby and Hecky Thump.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN><o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN 
style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">A quick 
change of footwear and the party wandered over to the Golden Lion to find Heavy 
Steve Machine sitting on his own after finishing the challenge in an amazing 8 
hours. <SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</SPAN>Steve later went on to 
finish a second, then a third evening meal before removing the stone from his 
shoe. <o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN 
style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Yup and 
Spike meanwhile, crawled up the steps on the last leg up Ingleborough as 
threatening clouds collected over Whernside behind them.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>One look from Yup and the storms receded 
and slipped off angrily in a southern direction towards Settle.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Spike meanwhile struggled to get a 
signal on his phone to say his goodbyes to his daughter Helen who announced she 
was leaving home the following day.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
</SPAN>Yup waited patiently and completed his pie challenge in Ali Gees 
honour.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>3 pie 
aaah.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN 
style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">It was 
generally agreed that the pull off from Ingleborough was incorrectly signed. 
<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</SPAN>A 1� mile fingerpost was passed, 
sited around 5 miles from where it should have been.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN 
style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">With phone 
signal strengths at their peak, contact was made with Yup and Spike.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Arrangements were made for well earned 
pints and meals to be prepared for them after they had fooled everyone by going 
on to finish the walk in another record breaking time of 14 hours. <SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</SPAN>Stir and Flash by this time had gone home

<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">It was a 
satisfying smug evening for the remaining weary, but elated, bunch of 
squarrites.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Everyone was truly 
knackered but the challenge had been won.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
</SPAN>Several had been sucking on Ibuprofen throughout the day which had 
obviously worked better than the pies.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
</SPAN>Congratulations must go to everyone for their determination in 
successfully completing the challenge.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">A few pints 
later and we crept back to our tents and collapsed onto our sleeping bags; too 
knackered to unzip and slide into them.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>

<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">�That�s my 
bottom hole�, was heard from an adjacent tent as the whispers subsided and the 
snoring slowly grew.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>The next 
morning the campers were all eager to sneak a curious peak at the sheepish 
looking victim. <SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</SPAN>The farmer who 
owned the campsite was also sneaking around, particularly around the shower 
block, pretending to check on the stock of toilet rolls.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>

<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">�3 Peaks 
Special� and the �Dales Special� breakfasts were consumed in the Settle-down 
caf�, before visiting a Craft Centre to purchase real ale gifts for the 
wives.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>

<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">It was 
great finally to return home to a hot bath, a gnat free environment, and a comfy 
chair. <SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</SPAN>Several days later and the 
gnat bites had stopped itching; the aching legs and pains had subsided, and we 
were ready to do it again.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Ooo. Did 
somebody just wake me up?<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>

go to Keithee for maintaining a determined push in going ahead with the
