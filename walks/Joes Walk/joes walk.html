9am prompt start was proposed for this walk, making allowances for the short
winter days, the anticipated 4 hour duration of the walk, the fact it gave us
all an extra hour in bed, common sense, oh and we’re all getting older. Still
a shock getting up during a Christmas break though, but the sight of a bright
red ‘saffron’ coloured sun rising at around 8.30 am, was worth it alone. No
allowance had been made for the pub door being closed until shortly before 9am,
so the group began to gather in anticipation outside the pub after a desperate
search for car parking spaces.</font></td>

<p>As the group increased in size to around a record breaking 31, it was good to
see old pioneer Dave Thacker returning after several years of absence. Also
present was Andy, (Van Gogh), who had mistakenly donned his painting trousers
for the walk but no one really noticed; and R-gee Bargee (The R standing for
Rover boy) turning up minus his christmas pressy of a hobgoblin tee shirt which
he was too embarrassed to put on.</p>
<p>When the doors finally opened we were invited to take a seat where we would
be served with oatcakes and coffee, mmmmhhh. Mo ‘who’, deprived of bacon
butties since his bread ‘ali gee’, became increasingly anxious and could
hardly wait for his bacon and cheese oatcakes to arrive. What we hadn’t
allowed for was Joe’s oatcake ordering inexperience, despite his many trips to
the pub to ‘see’ the landlord. Confusion reigned over pre-ordered and
non-pre-ordered oatcakes and chuntering was heard in one corner of the camp.
They did us proud eventually though, and thanks go to Joe for his efforts. Well
done Joe.</p>

So,
after a couple or three group snaps the walk started around 25 minutes behind
schedule. To make up time we set off at a gallop over the first couple of muddy
miles which Joseph had checked out. Ali Gee was in top form enjoying the first
stretch and promising to be more active in the future. That shouldn’t take
long to break. Graham Aukim impressed with tales of his migraines and the 3
tablets prescribed by his doctor which could kill him off. Lovingly, his wife
had told him she’d thrown them away. Little does he know that we know she’s
waiting to pop them in his dinner one night.</font></td>

<p>The pace increased to almost marathon pace to make sure we wouldn’t miss
out on valuable drinking time. (To avoid mud like you’ve never seen before,
several reckies had been previously carried out on most of the remaining
sections of the walk, and the route had been revised accordingly. On the down
side, this entailed more walking on roads than we would have preferred.) A short
regroup at a lake near Madeley and it was onwards and upwards to the Railway Inn
at Halmerend for a quick pint of Reverend Jimmy, or Burtonwood for those less
fortunate. Just enough time for JS, bird-man of Barlaston, to spot a couple of
grey fronted birds flirting above us. Another couple were spotted later in the
Plough, but that’s another story.</p>
<p>A splinter group led from the Railway, passing a wild neck-end cow grazing on
the green outside, to assure the landlord at The Plough that we were on our way.
As we settled, Stressed Eric assisted the waitresses with the food orders, who
shouted out the names from the pre-ordered list. Al Moorish, Timmee etc. The
locals must have found this very amusing wondering what planet we had come from.</p>
<p>The meals appeared in dribs and drabs as the ale disappeared in sips and
gulps. Hartington’s IPA was amongst the favourites; I can’t remember any
others after being persuaded to drink to excess by those around me and moving
onto the Jamesons later in the afternoon. Dave Woods (Boing) was unrecognisable
as the hairs on his chin grew waiting for his steak, becoming a beardy boy by
3pm. By 4pm he was unrecognisable by anyone, even his own mother, after
partaking of several pints of Owd Roger, aided and abetted by ‘Bamber Gascoine’
Matty, who had popped home to change into his drinking clothes. Gerben became a
true squarrite, picking up blisters on his travels, downing real ale and
Jamesons whiskey, becoming really forgetful, and … er …&nbsp;</font></p>

as ‘stressed Eric’ was beginning to unwind, the waitress asked if we wanted
puddings, aahhhh. A couple of trips&nbsp;&nbsp; outside to let off wind and&nbsp;he was back in
to take the orders. A group photo was taken by one of the 2 birds previously
referred to, who for some strange reason, and to our amusement, had to stretch
as far backwards as possible to get us all in the frame. Shocked by the sight of
Joe twopuddingsahoohigh demolishing not one but two puddings in the blink of an
eye, they took flight.</font></td>

<p>As Joe disappeared into the distance, after being dropped off in Cross Heath
by Mo, he could be heard to be muttering ‘never again, never again’. As Mo
arrived at home he could be heard to mutter ‘where’s me boots, why is Joe’s
rucksack in my boot?’.</p>

<p>Well done Joe, very well organised, and an excellent hike. Can’t wait for
