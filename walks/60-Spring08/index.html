<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">Carsington Damn 
it&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maunday Thursday </span></b>
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">20<sup>th</sup>

<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">18 were up for it, 
including Dan and his pal who joined us at the breakfast stop.&nbsp; Granpop Bill 
dropped out to save his hips.&nbsp; Nige had dropped out, Steve Machin took his place 
but dropped out himself at the last minute in fear of having to ride Nige’s 
bike.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">Yupmeister, Mid Week 
Tone, Keithee's up for it, JayCee, Graham Cork, Dasher, Spikelett, Mr Tahoohigh, 
Jacko, Rob Sparklette, John Thingy, Paul Hecky Thump, Tim Mothy, Andy Mander, 
Andrew Owen (Andy's bro-in law) and Jon Mason</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i><u>
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">Route:</span></u></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">Short circuit by 
foot from the visitors centre through Upper Town, then Hognaston and back along 
the dam.</span></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">The bike ride 
circled the reservoir anti-clockwise with a detour to Kirk Ireton (The Barley 
Mow) and on to Carsington (Miners Arms) for lunch.</span></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">A brisk march from 
the Miners Arms north to the High Peak Trail and Hopton before the march back 
down to the Miners Arms.</span></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">Return bike run to 
the visitors centre.</span></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">It was a dry start 
but cloudy and hopes were high that despite a manky weather forecast the 
weathermen would be proved wrong.&nbsp; JayCee’s pockets were bulging with plastic 
colostomy bags to keep his possessions dry throughout the impending rain.&nbsp; The 
only problem was that he was so bulked up that he was unable to turn to face the 
driver during conversations in the minibus.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">As we gathered and 
prepared for the start we stood in the entrance to the visitor centre, daring 
not to move to avoid opening the automatic doors and let a draft in. &nbsp;Not that 
we were nesh or anything.&nbsp; Outside was a model of the dam which looked flat 
enough. &nbsp;Should be an easy ride we thought……</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">Mid week Tone took 
the map and the lead and set us off on the first leg of the walk, immediately 
getting lost around the butterfly garden but then retrieving the correct route 
on to Upper Town and Hognaston, over poorly designed styles, unless you were a 
dog!!&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">Piles of logs could 
be seen in the wooded areas which Keithee confirmed had been left there for 
ecological reasons; bugs and squirmy creepy crawly things; wow.&nbsp; As we circled 
beyond the dam Yup had concerns that if the dam were to burst then we wouldn’t 
stand a chance; nor would the creepy crawlies. &nbsp;Keithee poo pooed the idea until 
realising it could be the last time any minutes would be taken (perhaps a good 
thing?).&nbsp; So with that in mind we speeded up and on to the top of the dam at the 
south east end and to a circular viewing area.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">The wind didn’t half 
blow as we returned to the visitors centre across the dam.&nbsp; Andy said the left 
side of his face was number than his last visit to the dentists.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">It was good to get 
out of the wind and into the café for the breakfast stop.&nbsp; Dan and his mate Mark 
(Jasper Carrot) joined us having enjoyed a lie in.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">Most opted for bacon 
baps, complete with a hefty dusting of flour, and attempted to find seats to 
avoid the blasts of hot air bellowing from the heaters.&nbsp; One or two gannets went 
for the big’un, (mentioning no names - Keithee, JayCee and Dasher) although 
Dasher was a little disappointed at the size of his portion.&nbsp; Well well.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">Attempts were made 
to displace the Kugel from its seating, a one tonne sphere of granite, before we 
briefly looked around Stones Island with its strategically placed viewing 
points. &nbsp;Wooden carved sculptures were also positioned around the area; one of 
which was a teapot which Mr Tahoohigh and Corker tried to squeeze another cuppa 
out of. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">Spike had sorted the 
bikes out for us, 2 of which had extremely comfy seats reserved for himself and 
Yuppers. &nbsp;A contract was written up before the bikes and the helmets were 
released, which Spike tried to avoid signing.&nbsp; Jaycee’s struggled to balance his 
helmet on top of his woolly hat which he refused to take off. &nbsp;&nbsp;Several, 
including 2-bike Thingy, had bought their own bikes and risked not wearing 
safety helmets.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">The first ten 
minutes cycle was across the dam.&nbsp; A very pleasant ten minutes as it was flat.&nbsp; 
At the far end the fun began with a short steep section where Yup, leading the 
pack, came to a sudden halt and stopped everyone else in their tracks, except 
for Dan and Mark (Jasper Carrot) who took great delight in showing off their 
expertise on 2 wheels with wheelies and spins.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">Alas the light rain 
showers began to fall.&nbsp; Thankfully, after another short pull there was a long 
gradual decline to the first pub, the Barley Mow, at Kirk Ireton, where we 
chained the bikes up and briskly moved indoors.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">A log fire awaited 
us.&nbsp; Hats, gloves and coats soon surrounded it and the orders for beer began.&nbsp; 
Only jugs were available.&nbsp; Pedro wouldn’t have stopped smiling had he been with 
us.&nbsp; Shame he was off on some exotic island far away on yet another holiday.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">‘Sharp’s own’ ale 
was eagerly supped by most.&nbsp; Graham reluctantly sampled it, as it wasn’t his 
normal cup of tea, but he soon warmed to it.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">Joe questioned the 
landlady of the unavailability of the Hook Norton ales which the pub was famous 
for providing.&nbsp; The landlady who appeared on several photos around the pub said 
she used to sell it but the locals refused to pay more than £2.25 a pint.&nbsp; As an 
alternative, Joe was offered IPA from a jug which soon put a smile on his face.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">JayCee tried to palm 
off his old pennies at the bar, as the landlady also had a previous reputation 
of putting up a fight against decimalisation.&nbsp; After piling his coins up on the 
bar in an Eifel tower shape, as he so often does I am informed, the landlady 
refused to accept them.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">Spike’s blamed his 
steamed up glasses, and not the amount he’d drank, when asking for another pint 
of snaps (Sharps).&nbsp; We’ll let him off this time as I’m not as thunk’ll drink he 
is.&nbsp; And Jacko stood against the fire drying off his wet ring.&nbsp; Without 
mudguards you do get well and truly splattered of course !</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">Reluctantly we left 
the pub and back into the light rain.&nbsp; Dan’s mate Mark (Jasper Carrot) had a 
rucksack drinks gadget with a long straw connected to a water reservoir.&nbsp; Now 
there’s a good idea for the future, but maybe with real ale …..&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">While Dan bought 
some cream eggs from the village shop, Joe struggled to unlock the bikes without 
a key.&nbsp; It was a long pull back towards the reservoir, before a further hour 
long stretch to the lunchtime pub, the Miners Arms.&nbsp; For Graham it was to be a 
while longer, having suffered a small prick, which punctured his tyre, 20 
minutes from the pub.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">Rob was glad to get 
to the pub safely, having realised the perils of not maintaining his son’s bike 
which he’d borrowed for the day, and almost coming a cropper on a hairpin bend.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">The food and the ale 
were excellent, with the chicken meals and the Archer’s ales taking top marks.&nbsp; 
The liver and onion meal ordered by Mid week Tone was devoid of onions but the 
waitress bought him an extra portion.&nbsp; Not to be outdone, JayCee allegedly had a 
liver and onions devoid of liver……</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">We waited for the 
few to receive their puddings.&nbsp; Joe had ordered apple pie but the cook, Mr 
Newton, must have waited until the apples had dropped from the trees before 
baking it.&nbsp; While we waited, a decision to take on the short walk option was 
made.&nbsp; After all, Tone had google-earthed the route so it’d be easy!&nbsp; So, the 
grand old Mid week Tone, he had just eighteen men.&nbsp; He marched us up to the top 
of the hill, and he marched us down again.&nbsp; And when we were up, we were up; and 
when we were down, we were down.&nbsp; But when we were only halfway up, we were 
neither up nor down!&nbsp; We did spot several commonly known trees when we were 
neither up nor down on the old mineral line; the ‘Pan’ tree and the ‘Lava’ 
tree.&nbsp; The county wounty wollers don’t need to employ arborists with such 
expertise amongst their own staff.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">Luckily, Keithee 
mentioned that he’d had only one meal and 4 pints, or else he’d have struggled 
to get up the 45 degree hill climb; unlike the rest of us.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">We finally slid back 
down to the pub garden and collected our bikes before making a neck breaking 
record back to return the bikes to the visitor centre by 5pm.&nbsp; Oh what joy!!&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">The bikes were hosed 
down by the guy who hired them out to us.&nbsp; Only being able to count up to ten he 
accused us of nicking one of his bikes until we lent a helping hand.&nbsp; </span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">Graham swore he’d 
never believe another word again about the terrain on future office walks.&nbsp; 
Perhaps the google-earth model Tone researched was in 2D not 3D.&nbsp; To be fair, we 
were all well and truly knackered; especially JayCee, who was at least grateful 
that he’d gained another qualification, an MSA (A mega sore arse).</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">At least with the 
hard work over, most could jump in their cars and return home, and the remaining 
few could at least relax in the pub just up the road, The Knockerdown Inn, 
before being picked up in the minibus.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">So with a refreshing 
pint in mind, the remaining few limped up to the pub ……. which was shut !!!!!!!!</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">At least we could 
shelter in an outside gazebo, listening to jokes from Dashers mobile as we 
waited for the pub to open.&nbsp; One in particular regarding ‘a coke bottle … and 
taking your thumb off the end’…. is one worth repeating in the future.&nbsp; I’m sure 
Dasher will find it for you sometime.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">Finally the landlady 
opened the doors for us and let us in, only for the ale to be flat.&nbsp; If only the 
walk had been!!</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">

research on the terrain and the pub opening hours, but for taking up the chalice 
in organising yet another fine event.</span></p>
