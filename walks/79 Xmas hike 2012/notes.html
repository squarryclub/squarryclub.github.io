white-washed cottages opposite the Mainwaring Arms, we set off, on time, slipping and sliding 
our way towards Hanchurch Woods.&nbsp; Rachel, in particular, was sliding more 
than most in her trainers, cursing her dad for choosing such a muddy route.&nbsp; We arrived at our proposed brekky stop, 
arranged by yours truly, around 9.45, delayed by around 15 minutes due to the 
mud.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Wow, what a welcome.&nbsp; A clearing amongst the trees had been prepared for 
us with a central table laden with tea and coffee, chairs and a roaring log fire.&nbsp; 
Signs had been put up asking us to take a seat and await the buttys, previously 
ordered.</p>
<p>More hot water and cold drinks were provided and as we settled down a box 
of red hot buttys were brought out and dished out as the recipients names were 
called.&nbsp; </p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">This must rate as 
the best ever brekky stop ever experienced on any of our office sqwalks, so top 
marks to Tony Latham and daughter from the lodge; and good luck with any future 
planning applications to become a cafe/refreshments outlet.<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</td>

We arrived at Slaters for lunch and slipped our muddy boots off before entering 
and mingling with a wedding party at the bar.&nbsp; So much for being told it 
would be quiet when we arrive.&nbsp; Tables however had been prepared for us 
upstairs so we headed up out of the way.<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The lighter meals were ample for most and the pie of the day comes highly 
recommended. The quality 
was excellent with an abundance of vegetables and extra chips.&nbsp; For some 
reason a couple of meals arrived late but the patience of those waiting was 
rewarded with even more vegetables etc.</td>
