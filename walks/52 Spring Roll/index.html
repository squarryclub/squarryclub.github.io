<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">SPRING WALK � A lea 
and a ledge, a-ledge-a-lea.</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">BOLLIN VALLEY/LINDOW 
MOSS/ALDERLEY EDGE&nbsp; 20km (12� miles)</span></b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">16 were up for this 
walk which was organised superbly by the one and only Jacko,&nbsp; The gang included 
Yup, Keithee, Graham, Pedro, Picasso, Heavy Steve Machine, Spike, Nige (noel), 
Joe Tahoohigh, Paul Lucasade, Sparky Rob, Digger Dave, John Nichol, Tim and his 
good neighbour Rob Unsworth.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">The start point was 
from the National Trust car park next to the Wizard Hotel, near Alderley Mill, 
Alderley Edge, just 8 miles north of Congleton off the A34.&nbsp; The Wizard it must 
be noted was a restaurant/hotel only so there would be no returning for a swift 
one before driving home (tel 01625 584000).&nbsp; The proposed start at 8am was 
delayed by around half an hour following the movement of cars from the car park 
to a lay by down the road for some reason I can�t remember, group photos and to 
drink a drop of the hard stuff handed out by Pedro and Picasso as a gesture of 
thanks to the squarry group for their support over recent months. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">The walk began at a 
rate of around 2k a minute, pushed by the 2 Keithees who were at it again, 
trying to make up for the delayed start and knackering everyone in the process.&nbsp; 
Were we bovered?&nbsp; We were slightly disenchanted however when we realised that 
visits to both the King William and the Boddington Arms had to be abandoned as 
time was running short!!&nbsp; A short cut through an estate and Lindow Common was 
also made leading us on to Lindow Moss; an area now filled with domestic refuse 
and covered in trees; and where the infamous body of Pete Marsh, was found in 
1984, evidently strangled by a ligature in a ritual killing during the Iron Age.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">Mumblings of �when�s 
the breakfast stop� began but were lost amongst the back packs.&nbsp; We passed 
around the south side of Rossmere where we became separated for a short while, 
and onwards to some steps into heathland.&nbsp; Grahams vast knowledge of the 
whereabouts of the local hostelries was immense, but alas they�d closed down 
since he gave up the drink. &nbsp;Graham�s knowledge extended to describing the 
history of this local lake which was filled with terrapins some years ago.&nbsp; 
These mutated into dinner plates and ate all the fish.&nbsp; Consequently the lake 
had to be drained and the terrapins removed.&nbsp; I personally think it was Graham 
himself who had performed this deed.&nbsp; Why else was he keeping his head down as 
we passed through his local territory?</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">Pedro took on his 
role of lollipop lady again to see us across a busy road at one point and Nige 
somehow head-butted a sign, although some said it was a kerb?&nbsp; When passing 
through a farm yard a horse stood firmly in our path and we had to detour 
slightly to get past.&nbsp; Even Nige who has got the horse whisperers powers 
struggled to squeeze past.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">Mumblings of �when�s 
the breakfast stop� began again and at last we stopped in a park with one bench 
in it for Yup.&nbsp; Pedro on the borrow again, and with only 7p on his phone, rang 
his wife to let her know Yup had got a seat.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">Out from Lindow 
Moss, and The Plough &amp; Flail came into sight at around the 14 km mark. (Tel 
01565 873537).&nbsp; A field on the left was stocked with a �mob� of ostriches with 
the owner bringing up the �rhea�.&nbsp; Nige �crane�d his neck to see them over the 
field gate.&nbsp; (What knowledge!!).</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">Guinness, Bass, 
Pedigree, Boddingtons, Leffe, Hoegarten and Stella were available at the 
Plough.&nbsp; Digger Dave opted for the Hoegarten and Picasso joined him with a 
couple of lemons.&nbsp; Digger D admitted he doesn�t often partake but Pedro added 
that his boyfriend does.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">Sitting in the fresh 
air at the entrance to the pub in our muddied walking gear we kicked off our 
boots and took great delight in obstructing the passage of the upper echelon 
attempting to enter for their gee and tees.&nbsp; We were moved on after a couple of 
pints by the landlady who decided to water the plants around us and wash away 
the mud off the patio.&nbsp; I tend to make things up as I go along if you haven�t 
already noticed.&nbsp; As Joe often says, �why confuse fiction with fact?�</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">As we moved on Pedro 
admitted to hearing Spike dumping at the first pub.&nbsp; Dumping what I wondered.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">We passed the Sewage 
works and Carr Farm before stopping at an old wooden garage, held together with 
string, which was full of old knick knacks.&nbsp; Nige scrummaged around the shelves 
hoping to build a rover but retreated in fear of it collapsing around him.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">A short while 
further on and John Nichol was chatted up by a lady out in her garden.&nbsp; When 
John informed her we were all from Stoke she turned her head and continued 
gardening.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">Digger Dave the 
gardener showed off his teeny weeny camera to Steve Machine who stood in 
admiration saying that he�d also prefer a thin one as his was too thick to 
handle.&nbsp; Pedro kept stum about his Box Brownie. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">Lunch time at last 
and we arrived at De Trafford Arms in Alderley Edge in good time.(01625 583881)&nbsp; 
Why can�t dey pronounce the in Altherley ethge?&nbsp; The Arms is open all day and 
serves the usual and Theakstons, Boddingtons, Pedigree and Bombardier.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">Graham, used to 
being barred from the local hostelries, sat on his own outside in the sun.&nbsp; Yes 
it had turned out to be another cracker of a day for another office walk.&nbsp; The 
rest of us piled into the farest corner of the pub and waited for the food to be 
served up.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">A discrepancy over 
the meals revealed Matty �Nice-one� had let us down by not turning up for his 
fish and chips.&nbsp; That fish could have fed thousands.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">The waitress was 
obviously not local.&nbsp; She was in fact Polish as discovered by Keithee who had 
come across her several weeks before when he got a hole in one.&nbsp; If you want to 
know more you�ll have to ask him yourself!!&nbsp; Announcing the pies with a speckled 
hen in a polish cum Mancurian dialect bemused Nige, who keen to get her 
attention asked if she would like an emu in her lounge.&nbsp; Obviously a common 
phrase in Biddulph that she would readily understand.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">2 pints and a meal 
downed we woke Mr Tahoohigh up.&nbsp; He admitted to not being able to sleep lately 
and had even pretended he was at work in the office, but even that hadn�t 
worked.&nbsp; Steve Machine admitted to playing with Dave Wood and had done his 
ligaments in, but we decided to leave it at that.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">We split up shortly 
after De Trafford Arms, with some returning to the car park via a steep sided 
woodland area and Pedro, Yup and Graham continuing on to Prestbury along country 
lanes via another couple of pubs before catching the train back to Stoke 
station.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">Pedro complained, 
sorry commented, that there were supposed to be 5 pubs on the way back to the 
station at Prestbury as promised by Graham.&nbsp; Graham apologised for his mistake 
and agreed that there were in fact 7.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">At the Bulls Head at 
Mottram Cross Pedro complained, sorry commented, that his ale was flat, just to 
get another free pint of Speckled Hen.&nbsp; An hour later, and Spike and Rob joined 
the motley crew at The Bulls Head, before setting off again down country lanes 
to Prestbury in search of the infamous Admiral Rodney, recommended by Jacko.&nbsp; 
Grahams immense knowledge of the pubs came in handy again as we tried to find 
old Rodders.&nbsp; Graham was adamant the pub had been renamed but in the end we 
asked a local yob who confirmed its location just a few hundred yards along the 
main road.&nbsp; Rodders was full of well dressed gents in jackets and ties who had 
just finished a hard days work in the office; just like we would have done.&nbsp; As 
the 6.57 train loomed ever nearer we darted out of the pub and over the bridge 
linking the platforms.&nbsp; The fat controller seeing Spike doubled over on the 
bridge and looking in pain held up the train.&nbsp; He was in fact letting off 
�steam� as he does from time to time, before jumping on the train. &nbsp;To his 
credit it was a wise move.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">Robs experience of 
travelling on the train paid off as we jumped aboard towards the front of the 
second class.&nbsp; Evidently the conductor usually starts his ticket checks at the 
back end of the second class compartments and generally doesn�t have sufficient 
time to progress to the front end.&nbsp; A useful tip from Sparky.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">We escaped into the 
streets of Stoke to Sangams for a quick balti and a chat about the third world 
etc all sparked off by Spikes holiday in Cuba.&nbsp; Rob jumped back on board the 
train again back to Stafford; in one of the front carriages again of course.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">Jacko had intended 
to give us some stick; dip sticks in fact, for testing glucose levels.&nbsp; Perhaps 
as well he was too hyper to remember.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">A super day�s outing 
again and superbly organised by Jacko who gave himself a hernia in the process.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">Regards</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
