<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><b><font face="Arial"><a href="https://squarryclub.github.io/walks/59-Winter07/Xmas07/index.html">Click here for photos </a> </font></b></p>

<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font face="Arial">The winter bug had taken its toll on several hikers this Christmas leaving only the following 18 resilient tough�uns: Yup, Pedro, Keithee�s up for it, Dasher, DCeen, McCeen, Spikelette, Mr Tahoohigh, Heavy Steve Machine, Nige (Noel) Thingy, Graham Awkward, Tim Mothy, Mid week Tone, Barry, Matt Nice-one, Zolette and Looo. </font></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font face="Arial">Route details: South east from Keele university through Springpool Wood and Lymes Road before returning back to the University Clock House. West to Keele village and down Station Road, bearing south west to Madeley via Hungerford Lane. Breakfast stop at the Offley Arms at Madeley Pools and return eastwards via Lower Stoney Low and the Gables, before reaching the main road leading back northwards to the Sneyd Arms at Keele. North along Quarry Bank Road and the B5044 to the Bush at Silverdale before returning back via Park Road and Keele Road to Keele University. Full distance approx 11 miles. </font></p>

<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font face="Arial">The walk began from the car park in front of the students union at Keele University, where parking was free over the Christmas holiday period. Yup led the group to the cash machine before entering the forecourt of Keele Hall, a throwback to Harry Potters� Hogwarts, and providing an opportunity for a couple of group photos. G-awkward hobbled round with the aid of walking sticks to support his knee which was giving him some jip; and Looo, sporting a fine pair of pink walking boots, expertly dodged the puddles as we passed the pools in the gardens, managing to keep them in pristine condition. </font></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font face="Arial">The forecast was for heavy showers for the morning, dying away by mid afternoon. Not spot on but near enough. It was mild and damp with light rain interspersed with heavier bursts. But who was bothered. Pedro certainly wasn�t, as he spluttered through the morning spreading his flu germs far and wide, and gasping for breath at every opportunity. </font></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font face="Arial">We arrived at the Offley Arms at Madeley at around 10.30 where we were shown into a mini banqueting hall with a realistic looking log fire. Tea and coffee pots were put out for us followed by bacon butties. Barry�s only complaint was that there could have been more tea and coffee made available but Spikelette was happy to find some brown sauce. </font></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font face="Arial">Mid week Tone confirmed the proposal to hold a collection for charity on each winters walk, starting today with www.digdeep.org.uk, a charity which aims to sink a well in Kenya. It is currently just short of �3,000 but between the 18 of us we didn�t quite expect to reach this shortfall today!! A collection to pay for the butties with a tip was made and the surplus was bagged for the charity. Thanks chaps and chapplettes for your donations. </font></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font face="Arial">A heavier shower hit us as we started off again, some of us lucky enough to see a frightened deer scurrying off across one of the fields. We squelched into the Sneyd Arms in Keele village where Black Sheep, Bombardier and Abbott were available. Dasher finally crossed the threshold by supping a full pint of ale without the threat of diluting lemonade, and Thingy was also spotted supping ale. Barry, on his fifteenth pint, said he was taking it easy as he was out later that evening. Spikelette, Nice-one and Heavy Steve Machine took to the pool table whilst McCeen bartered by phone for a sports car with a soft roof. Meanwhile Pedro indulged in a technology conversation involving transferring photos via the internet but floundered in the terminology. However, he did say he�d give Tube-face.com a whirl in the new year. </font></p>

<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font face="Arial">The Bush was only half an hour away. Tables were cleared for us whilst we waited in the back room and placed our drinks orders. Townhouse Cascade was the only available gold ale but a fairly wide choice of Christmas ales were also available. Zolette opted for the Beartown�s Ho Ho Ho which tasted of sweaty socks. </font></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font face="Arial">An extra table was drafted in with a small stool for Nige (no-el) and the food orders began to emerge from the kitchens. A mega-grill was trolleyed in for Keithee�s up for it, which he failed to finish. 3 chips more and he�d have surpassed everyone�s expectations. He�d have preferred more salad evidently! Yes� </font></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font face="Arial">There were a few esca-pees on our table which Looo cleared up before requesting puddings. Sadly we were informed that they had finished puddings for the day. Pedro�s reputation lay in tatters and pleas were made to the chef. We were revolting, so to avoid a scene they relented and orders were taken. Pedro was fully pardoned. Treacle sponges were top of the list although one awkward diner requested bread and butter pudding with ice cream. Heavy Steve Machine shouted �make mine a spotted dick� but Mr Tahoohigh confirmed he�d already got one. </font></p>

<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font face="Arial">A mucky field and a heavy shower finished the day off nicely. It made a change to the hot, sunny days we�ve recently become accustomed to, but a most enjoyable day, �wheather� or not. </font></p>
