<p>Feel free to send in your reviews.  One squarrite, who can&#8217;t be named, left a comment <i>&#8216;Effing good breakfast&#8217;</i>  in a guest book in a &#8216;b&amp;b&#8217; in Ireland. That would sometimes suffice, but if you wanted to be a little more thorough then perhaps you could refer to the service, quality of food, cost, size of nans, fresh pappodoms, availability of mixed or lime pickles, decor, size of bogs? availability of draught lagers, can you take your own drinks, or even the size of rats running around the kitchen etc etc.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m asked on numerous occasions what certain items on menus consist of.  Click <b><a href="../../recipes/Yup%27s%20quick%20reference%20menu%20guide.html" target="_blank">here</a></b> for a quick reference guide.  If you spot any dish not included then please let me know and I&#8217;ll add it to the list.</p>

The service and set up is very professional.  A place for youngsters, party animals and the like; which is why we went!  Nans hung off supports on tables.

<td valign="top" width="201">The Aneesa The Midway, Newcastle</td>
<td valign="top">Azar, the owner is always welcoming.  Curry strengths tend to be hot but all appear similar in colour.  We used to frequent this Indian often and like to think we helped it’s presence in its early days, insisting on one occasion that they pop out to the supermarket to purchase some onion chutney for us as it wasn’t on the menu.  An old favourite of the squarry club. Several years though since we last visited. Good service and value. Beware the Jalfrezi, it used to be mighty hot.</td>

<td valign="top" width="201">The Balti House, Nottingham</td>
<td valign="top">Visited in May 2013.  <span style="line-height: 19px;">This is the longest established Indian in Nottingham city centre and had good reviews on tripadvisor, so should have been a good choice.  The moustached boss-man was very welcoming and recommended the party menu option as we were tight on time: this offered less choice of main courses but included popadoms and mixed starters for a usual price of £15.95, which he reduced to £13.95 for our party. Wine was ordered at the very cheap price of less than £5 a bottle, but was soon rejected by most, who changed to the Cobra.  The pops and starters went down well but the mains weren’t of very good quality and Yuppers gave the owner some feedback that may have been a little harsh. The bill came to less than £20 each, though another time we would pick a better quality restaurant as there are many to choose from in Nottingham.</span></td>

<td valign="top" width="201">Barn India,  Woore</td>
<td valign="top">Visited 26th April 2013.  A little bit off the beaten track, but a very pleasant restaurant situated in a converted barn, with a charming rustic entrance and cosy reception, the main dining area was light and airy which complimented the comfortable and relaxed atmosphere.  The service was very efficient and friendly, with the waiter taking time to explain the more exotic dishes on the menu, the various courses and drinks all came in timely order, despite there being twelve in our party.  All three courses were of high quality, well cooked and very tasty, with a really good choice of main meals.  We were all very happy with the food, service and value for money, possibly 9 out of 10.One other note to mention, there was also a doggy bag service which was most welcome, with Yuppy letting go of the reins somewhat this year, we digressed and indulged in a starter, needless to say some of us (I) could not finish our main meal and it went home with us (me!)

<td valign="top" width="201">Bengal Lodge on A34 near Darlaston, Stone.</td>
<td valign="top">Visited 31/9/06  Previously a Little Chef on the A34 near Darlaston, this Indian is remote from any worthwhile pub and could be situated anywhere, you wouldn’t know you were sitting just a few yards away from a main dual carriageway. The inside is contemporary and spotlessly clean. The food is well presented and the service excellent. Drinks were provided on the house after the meal which cost £45 for 2 including starters and wine. The pappodoms and accompaniments were almost the best ever and the peshwari nan breads, lightly covered with honey were scrumptious. The onion bhajis were disappointing. The main courses were good. Roses were handed to the ladies at the end of the meal.</td>

Contemporary but comfortable surroundings, licensed (but only till 11pm – beware) and slightly expensive, but then you pay for quality. Dill (from Chillies) joined in the summer of 2008 and has already boosted its popularity status with the squarry club.  Visited April 06 &#8211; The food was excellent and commended by all.  Crafty, not yet converted to real ale, also commended the lager.Visited May 08 &#8211; The service was slow, the poppodoms were late, and Yup’s curry had to be sent back to the kitchen to be replaced with the one he’d ordered.  Craigee had more chillies than he could handle.  All in all, a fairly good meal, but with poor service the tip was reduced accordingly,</td>

A good contender for a future visit.Went to ‘Moments’ on Friday last (formerly the Mexican Tapas restaurant) at Meir Heath, where we had a small but perfectly formed Korma. Probably, not to the strength and quantity for your die-hard curry members, but as a starter to compare with others it was tasty, but not overwhelming.Very ‘upmarket’ surroundings; service was good if slightly rushed (we’d only just been shown to our table, when we being asked for our drinks order!). I suspect it was as much to do with the need to ‘turn over’ tables, as it was good service, given that it was full. Parking limited – used Windmill opposite.Cost – slightly more than elsewhere with smaller portions. Nan bread lovely – light and tasty whether garlic or peshwari. Bogs – didn’t use. Licensed bar – had £10.90/house wine. Rats – none.Dasher</td>

<td valign="top">Visited Dec 08  AND NEVER AGAINAn impressive entrance with murals adorning the walls, and a river literally running along the floor, following a water burst.  There was consequently no heating and the central fountain was out of commission.  Unsurprisingly, there was no-one else in the restaurant.  Several trips were attempted to the toilets, where the ‘checked every half an hour’ board was last signed off in 1752 by Sir John Vernon of Sudbury. There was no wine available and meals were served in dribs and drabs.  Patience wore thin as an eternity passed before the first few meals were bought out and placed on an adjacent table to chill before being distributed.  Some of the rices were handed out, some of which were frozen, and several other dishes passed around haphazardly in an attempt to appease us.  In all, the service was atrocious and by far the worst ever meal and service experienced by the squarry club.  A bill of several hundred was instantly dismissed and eventually a fiver a head was accepted as a take it or leave it final offer to cover everything.</td>

<td valign="top">Visited by Yupmeister and Mrs Yupmeister on 27/8/05.  Our visit to Nawaabs was made even more enjoyable by a taxi ride in Mr B’s taxi (no 24). ‘You ask for me, Mr B’, he repeated. So we did.The restaurant was buzzing. A couple of parties were in and there was some pretty loud music playing in the background. Luckily the hotel we were staying in had made our booking, otherwise I doubt if we’d got in. It was bulging to bursting. We sat talking to some locals in the bar area before the meal who had been using the restaurant for over 13 years and praised the quality and the staff before leaving. The Nawaabs is part of an international chain, there’s also one in Leeds, Bradford and Manchester evidently. They recommended lamb chops for starters ….. so we went along with it.Top marks to the quality of the food. Baltis are presented in a small balti dish and are much drier than the stokey baltis. They are however, very tasty. We shared a Nirali special and the chicken badami with the obligatory peshwari nan bread and pilau rice. Couldn’t fault anything really except the waiters, who were a bit reserved you might say, but very efficient. No photo of the bogs cus I didn’t have my camera, but they were above average condition.  A large mirror adorned the far wall making the place appear bigger than it was, but giving a bigger panoramic view for anyone sitting facing the wall. The prices were reasonable; £40 total for two including the bottles of merlot and cobra. Shame it’s too far out for an evenings trip, or is it?

There may well be other good ones about but this is convenient and has always been good value, with good service and food.The Bangla, a pumpkin curry, was particularly scrummy.</td>

<td valign="top" width="201">The Prachee, Keele</td>
<td valign="top">Visited Dec 09.  The Prachee meaning ‘eastern’ in Bengali, is set in an unusual setting overlooking the golf course.The delivery was exceedingly slow. In dribs and drabs, and balti dishes, the food gradually emerged. First the main meal, and a while later a rice, if you were lucky. Occasionally a nan would appear. The food was good but could have been so much better if it had been served in its entirety over a short period.  Hopefully not ‘par for the course’ !!  Now closed (March 2016)</td>

Chicken tikka and hot chillie nan breads produced by request were excellent.</td>

Good pub across the road with award winning garden.The food was served in Churchill’s best on a spotlessly clean whiter than white table cloth. The general consensus was that the restaurant was impressive and the grub was excellent.  Thai food was also available and Bill was tempted into having the Thai beef red curry which he claimed was another first.  The nans were served cut in half and were a reasonable size and extremely tasty.  No complaints from our end and there are intentions to return soon with families. The toilets were upstairs so I didn’t bother. I understand it now sells indian food only?</td>

<td valign="top" width="201">Staffers, Shelton</td>
<td valign="top">Visited June 11.  Note – Under a new name and management yet again in Jan 13.  Once known as The Elms technical college, it was transformed into a restaurant many years ago becoming The Elms Restaurant and more recently Shaffers.  Several rooms are available.  The waiter was very patient and was on top of the game in sorting us out, even giving us the choice of the food being served in balti dishes or on plates. Armed with discount vouchers from the ‘thisisstaffordshire’ website we disagreed with the waiter when the final bill was presented, but we finally resolved the issue. Excellent food.</td>

<td valign="top">Visited March 06.  The attention and hospitality at the Shalimar was second to none; especially after Keithee explained we’d be putting a review on the website!  Imran, our friendly waiter, attended to our every need and didn’t laugh too loud when a couple of steaks were ordered by the ‘sat-nabs’.  Visited again in Feb 11Pedro’s meal, a biriani with egg and pineapples, did look appetising. However, the meals were served lukewarm, and in addition, despite the brandies and sambuccas, the final bill proved to be very expensive. Mid week Tone sorted the bill out in Keithee’s absence and managed to get a £1 reduction after some discussions with the owner. So, we definitely wouldn’t return to the Shalimar.</td>

<td valign="top">Visited by Yup and Mrs Yup on 17th February 2005.  Sadly, Reza, the chef and star from Delhi Belly (UK TV), wasn’t resident at the restaurant when we popped in, just a few grumpy waiters. The restaurant was packed with diners, so it was a good job we’d booked a table several weeks earlier.Reza’s can be found on Old Brompton Road, about ½ a mile west of the South Kensington underground station, and is surrounded by several other restaurants and pubs. We were shown to a smaller quieter room at the rear of the main dining area on the ground floor, only big enough for 4 small tables. I didn’t want a fuss making over my appearance. An upstairs room was also available which I later discovered was almost as big as downstairs and had its own bar.  The service was pretty efficient, but the waiters appeared grumpy and hardly uttered a word as they took the orders and served the meals. Evidently, one of them was polite and even smiled when I later slipped off to the boy’s room.We skipped the starters and went for the traditional pappodoms and chutney tray. Both were presented extremely fresh, just as you’d hope for and gave us reassurance that the trip had been worthwhile. I wish now we’d have tried a starter cus they looked really tasty and unusual, unlike the usual common starters you get at most places.The main courses we chose were Murg Khumb Bahar and Murg Tikka Zafrani; the first one mainly consisting of chicken, mushrooms and cashew nuts, and mine consisting of chicken and chillies. A chillie nan and a peshwari rice completed the order along with a bottle of red wine at around 12 quid. The total bill came to just under £50. They wouldn’t give me a menu for future reference so this <a href="../reviews/Rezas/menu%20only.html" target="_blank">menu </a>is from memory only.The décor was unusual with ornately painted ceilings. A couple behind us were having a right argee bargee with each other which made interesting listening.The food was excellent and we will definitely be going back. Not huge helpings, but just right and the quality was excellent. (Shame about the waiters.) Mr &amp; Mrs Yup.  Obviously more expensive than most but well worth a visit.A squarry visit was finally made by the Squarrites in Nov 2011.</td>

<td valign="top">Visited Dec 10.  Looks like a carpet warehouse building down an alleyway.  A buffet meal was set up for us following platters of mixed starters, and poppodoms comprising chicken tikka masala, chicken tikka, jalfrezi, lamb dupiaza and chicken bhuna; with rices and a variety of nan breads. Beer and wine had been previously delivered, as the restaurant is unlicensed, and all seemed to go down well. Well done to everyone at the ‘Taste’.  An excellent night.</td>

Fresh, crisp poppodoms were promptly bought to the table after our order. Fair and tasty portions of chutneys. Nans were cut into quarters to save having to rip them apart.Large bottles of Cobra were around a fiver each with wine being too expensive starting at around £18. The 2 for 1 main course deal is well worth taking advantage of if you can vacate the table by around 7.30pm. Very good service and an abundance of waiters in full dress.</td>

<td valign="top">Visited March 11.  Crossing the M5 we located Roebuck Street and followed the map down to the Vine. Unless you had a map or knew where it was you would easily miss it.  A hidden gem within an industrial estate.2 large rooms and smaller snugs with large bbq to the rear. There were specials, standard curries and BBQ’s available, clay pots and tin pots, and real ale/guest beers at the bar. What more could a man want.The BBQ’s were £3.50 whilst the main dishes including rices and nan were a bargain at around £7.50. There were all types of meat available, but when asked if we wanted goat curry, well, ‘you’ve got to be kidding’, someone bleated.Several went for the bbq’d hot chicken tikka masalla, which lived up well to its description, and then a honey and chillie chicken main at £4.25, with rice and nan at around an extra couple of quid each. There was no final bill to settle up as you paid for your meal when ordering.  The route to Kendrick Park metro station, about 10 minutes away was a poorly lit area. I wouldn’t recommend this route if you hadn’t got Granpop Bill with you.</td>
