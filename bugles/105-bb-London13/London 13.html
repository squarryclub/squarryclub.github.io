help yet again as we boarded the wrong train from Aldgate back to Euston.&nbsp; 
Luckily the 
situation was retrieved and a direct train was found taking us directly to 
Euston where we slipped in to the packed Bree Louise pub.&nbsp; Pity the ale didn’t 
excel despite the CAMRA discount.&nbsp; Next year the Euston Tap !!</span></p>
