Wetherspoons??<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>So prenuptials were
partaken at the Hogs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Abbott
and array of other real ales was as delightful as usual and eased our rapacious
thirsts.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The distress appeared on
one or two faces as the clock ticked by and the stomachs began to rumble.<span style="mso-spacerun:

bolognese before setting out, just in case we were late!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Finally, we had made it to the oldest Indian in Newcastle.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The elusive Koh-I-noor, or Koo I nuer as we locals call it, had become
yet another notch on our belts.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>My

reluctant Trigg into the heart of the town.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Steve�s recollection of the

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;<i>�Just to inform you
of myself and Trigg's whereabouts on Wednesday after leaving the Koh-i.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>We took leave of Pablo Franki's since it was full of blokes and finally
nested in Fluid.&nbsp;
</i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><i>Trigg made numerous comments
on the sheer &quot; quality and quantity &quot; of the abundance of young
attractive ladies.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It made a
fitting end to the evening as Trigg will probably agree since he was rooted to a
spot at the bar with a silly little boy look on his face as a young piece of
fluff gyrated upon his frontal area.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>When
I finally managed to drag him away - before his trousers got damp - Trigg
frequently commented on the &quot; quality and quantity &quot; of the afore
mentioned young lovelies, all the way home in the taxi.�<span style="font-size:6.0pt;

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
normal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Old English Text MT&quot;">So
where is Neckend?</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Old English Text MT&quot;"><font face="Baskerville Old Face">Some
say it�s Longton way and of course they�re right, but to anyone from in and
around the civilised world of Castle, true Neckend begins at Boslem. Venture
further North and it degenerates further passing through Tunstall until you
reach a sleepy little backwater called Kidsgrove where the real decline sets in.
To anyone from castle it�s like going back in time into the dark ages, a real
shock to the system when entering for the first time.</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Old English Text MT&quot;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
normal">So
what�s it like?</b><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal; font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Old English Text MT">&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Baskerville Old Face"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">There
you�ll find a very primitive little hamlet not for the Architecturally
aspired. The little mud and straw huts provide for luxurious accommodation for
the local inhabitants or �Neckenders�. The unmade tracks provide for ample
grip for their four legged modes of transport. The �Neck and End Canal� is
situated at its heart. This provides for much needed nourishment for the locals
who can readily scoop the dead fish from the surface of the stagnant water.
&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
normal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Old English Text MT&quot;">So
what do they do?</span></b>
</p>
<span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><font face="Baskerville Old Face">During
the day when they�re tired of eating the fish, the menfolk go a hunting for
the hogs with their home made spears. When successful the whole of Neckend
celebrates with a hog roast cooked on the open fire and a jug of ale from the
local hostelry. Speaking of which, the local pub provides their evenings
entertainment. It�s not quite what we�re use to in Castle with bright
lights, music, fit young tarts and of course the fine selection of smooth beers.
This is a very seedy place with sawdust and straw floors and furniture made from
pieces of flotsam and jetsam found washed up in the local cut. As for the local
brew, I�ve tried it and it must be made from a mixture of fermented Hogs urine
and stagnant canal water it�s really not for the faint hearted. The locals
seam to enjoy it though but then they don�t really know any different.</font></span><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:&quot;Old English Text MT&quot;">&nbsp;</span><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
normal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Old English Text MT&quot;">So
what of the people, who would really live in such a place?</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Baskerville Old Face"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">A
neckend</span></font><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><font face="Baskerville Old Face">er
is unlike anyone you�ve ever seen before except perhaps in very old black and
white movies. They are very backward and simple people. They have to be tough to
live there. The men look like rag and bone men with staw hats, unwashed and
unshaven. The women are just dogs.&nbsp;</font></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><font face="Baskerville Old Face">So
why are you been told all this. Well it�s because the next Squarry outing is
to be at Neckend. A group of Indians have moved into the outskirts of Neckend
and have opened a Balti Restaurant. This has confused the locals who have never
seen a restaurant before, nevermind an Indian and so keep well clear. The
Indians are trying to coax in the local Neckenders by creating some new dishes
such as popadogs, Doggie Kebabs and Hog roast tikka masala, The balti dish
should come as no surprise to a neckender as they are use to eating from round
bowls they carve out of tree stumps. Cutlery would pose a problem to them
though.</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:6.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Old English Text MT&quot;">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><font face="Baskerville Old Face">For
those who came to the last outing to Neckend, they�ll know what to expect but
for those venturing for the first time please note the following. Don�t dress
up too much or they�ll think you�re a Nancy boy and they don�t like them.
Don�t wash or put on any deodorant or aftershave instead rub your hands and
face in soil or coal dust even better if you have solid fuel heating. Don�t
use long words or sentences, keep it simple and short. Grunting is good.
Remember to spit on the floor at least every few minutes. Try to fit in, I know
it will be difficult but it�s for your own good. Finally don�t bring any
pets with you of any description or you�ll regret it. Have a good night.</font></span></p>
