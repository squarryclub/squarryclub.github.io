<td colspan="4">Tone and Pedro walked from home to the station and were joined 
for the early part by Ken Spencer and his dogs. Train tickets were purchased for 
a very reasonable £12.60 even though group savers weren’t available. The 
single-carriage train took us to Derby where there was a bit of a problem with 
finding the Nottingham train – after a quick circuit of the newly refurbished 
station we came back to the same platform we’d arrived at and eventually found 
the right platform – the confusion was understandable as Stokies are only used 
to having 2 platforms to choose from. </td>

<tr>
<td colspan="2">At Nottingham it was only a short walk to the first pub, the Vat 
and Fiddle, the taphouse of the Castle Rock Brewery that sits just behind the 
pub. Graham was already on his 2nd pint, sitting at the tables outside the pub 
and the rest of us joined him in the sunshine – summer seemed to have finally 
arrived after the coldest spring for many years. </td>

<td width="449" colspan="2">There were plenty of staff behind the bar and a full 
array of Castle Rock beers, plus Titanic Plum Porter as guest beer. Most seemed 
to go for the best known, Harvest Pale, or the Bouncing Bomb, or the tribute 
beer to our New Zealand friends, Elsie Mo. But there was also a stout that Pedro 
was happy to start on. No Camra discount was on offer but at £2.20 a pint it was 
cheap enough; however there was a reward system that needed us to get cards 
stamped. They also accepted Camra Wetherspoon vouchers, which Tone took 
advantage of. 
<p>Food was ordered by most and came along quite quickly. Second pints were 
ordered and the cards filled up so Graham went to get our 2 free pints – he 
seemed to be confused by the pleasant black bar girl, but it was quite simple: 2 
full cards, 2 free pints and no, Graham, you don’t get ½ a pint for a ½ full 
card – nice try though.</p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">Not the best 
outlook from the front of the pub but a passer-by reminded some how much they 
liked jelly and blancmange. Bill got his smart phone out to watch the 
England/New Zealand cricket match so we knew it was time to leave before Yup 
dropped off.</td>

<td colspan="4">Walking back past the station we got to the tram terminus and 
immediately got onto the next tram. We went through the city centre and noticed 
children playing in the fountains and water feature in the main square – yes, 
summer had arrived, so why were we all in our coats and fleeces?<p>The £2 fare 
took us to the Trent University campus where we should have been getting off: 
surprisingly no Notters wanted to get off here, only us Squarrites and Yuppers 
didn’t understand that you had to touch the door to get it to open, so the tram 
set off again. Luckily by the next stop the locals had instructed Yup on the 
door-opening method and we piled off.</p>

<td colspan="2">Tone consulted one of his personal 3 maps, showing the route for 
the day, and back streets were taken to get us back to the Canning Circus area 
of the City and into the Organ Grinder pub. This is the main outlet for the Blue 
Monkey Brewery and all their beers seemed to be on offer, except the 
award-winning Ape Ale, but there was plenty of choice and the golden-coloured 
ales were most popular – BG Sips and Infinity being the main ones. We settled 
outside again on the rooftop beer garden, which was a real sun-trap. By the time 
second pints were ordered the Ape Ale was on tap so had to be sampled.
<p>Stubbie was letting us know about one of his favourite TV programmes of late 
as the bar maid reminded him of Zena Warrior Princess.</p>

<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">Bang on schedule 
we moved on across the road to the nearby Sir John Borlase Warren, named after a 
local 18th century Admiral. An almost empty pub didn’t give a good first 
impression but the young staff offered us a sample of one of their guest Ales.

Keithee seemed to like it but the few who ordered that brew soon sent it back as 
it was off. London Pride and several Everards beers were on tap but, sticking 
with the pale ales, everyone went for the Sunchaser and headed out back into 
another fine beer garden.

Bill and Pedro weren’t impressed with the place and/or beers so went back to the 
Organ Grinder. </td>

<td colspan="2">Meeting up again outside we all set off downhill towards the 
city centre. In St James Street we entered a real gem of a pub – the Malt Cross 
is advertised as a Christian charity cafe bar. It’s in one of only a few 
remaining Victorian Music Halls and has also been a church. Fortunately it also 
does real ale and they had 2 Castle Rock beers on offer along with a few others. </td>

larger-than-life black guy. Yup was snap-happy, taking photos of the pub’s 
impressive interior, though he didn’t impress photography student Hard Dave when 
he tried to get arty, taking a view of the place via a wall-mounted mirror. 
Keithee was noticed admiring the structural cast iron columns. </p>

<td colspan="2">Leaving the Malt Cross we passed the main square and water 
features seen from the tram earlier. There was just time for photos by the Brian 
Clough statue on the way to the Lace Market area and the Indian restaurant, the 
Balti House. This is the longest established Indian in Nottingham city centre 
and had good reviews on tripadvisor, so should have been a good choice. </td>

<td width="449" colspan="2">The boss-man was very welcoming and swapped 
moustache-based compliments with Pedro. He recommended the party menu option as 
we were tight on time: this offered less choice of main courses but included 
popadoms and mixed starters for a usual price of £15.95, which he reduced to 
£13.95 for our party. Wine was ordered at the very cheap price of less than £5 a 
bottle, but was soon rejected by most, who changed to the Cobra. However, 
Keithee again seemed to have a different taste to the rest of us and polished 
off a bottle or 2 of the vino. The pops and starters went down well but the 
mains weren’t of very good quality and Yuppers gave the owner some feedback that 
may have been a little harsh. The bill came to less than £20 each, though 
another time we would pick a better quality restaurant as there are many to 
choose from in Nottingham.</td>

<td colspan="4">&nbsp;<p>In the end we had plenty of time to stroll back to the 
station and get our trains. Graham had set off slightly earlier to get his 
alternative route back but joined us on the Derby train when his route was 
affected by a “suicide jockey”, though I don’t think that was what the station 
announcer called it.</p>
<p>It had been another good day with 3 out of the 4 pubs being rated as 
“excellent” but was let down a bit by a disappointing curry. </p>
