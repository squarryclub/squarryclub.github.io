<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">Several BBC 
(Bowling Beer and Curry) broadcasts had been sent out; the transport was 
arranged, the indian was booked, the green was booked and the teams were finally 
ready.&nbsp; Most importantly, the ale had been collected and delivered to the club.&nbsp; 
Up for it were most of the Squarrites and the Sparklers.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">The evening 
started for the Squarrites at a typical Stoke dump; Harry’s bar, arranged by 
Keithee in his new delegated role as Yup’s transport manager.&nbsp; The minibus was 
booked for 4.30pm, or for two others 4.40pm! &nbsp;Once the latecomers had climbed on 
board we set off.&nbsp; The driver was a kind, patient chap and had no problem at all 
being held up for ten minutes or so.&nbsp; He was even good enough to have modelled 
his looks on Keithee, an additional free service available to anyone booking the 
bus.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">The driver made 
good time in getting the lads to Stafford, in fact such good time surprisingly 
nobody asked him to stop in the pits for a wee stop, and him being such an 
amiable chap, I’m sure it would have been no problem at all. &nbsp;Although in 
defence to “dasher” some of the lads made a dash for it once off the bus. &nbsp;&nbsp;Keithee 
then entered into tense ‘head to head’ ‘take no prisoners’ negotiations with the 
driver and paid in full up front.&nbsp; Keithee was heard to say, ‘that was tough, 
but I think I got what I wanted’. &nbsp;The driver threw the lads off next to a 
convenient chip shop which some walked past, including Yuppers and Ali G 
miraculously, who tried to convince every body including themselves that they 
were o.k. and didn’t really want any pies or chips. &nbsp;The Railway Inn was 
literally only round the corner and was a fine venue with wide screen TV showing 
a cricket match (zzzzzzzzz), and guest beers.&nbsp; Beardee, making his first 
appearance of the year, scored it a 1 out of 10, equalling ‘excellent’ in the 
world of real ale establishments. &nbsp;Fine ales including Bombardier, Abbott, Bass, 
Deuchers for Yuppers and some Smooooth for the smoooth boys were consumed and 
chips shared out by Keithee and Stubbee with the lads by those who couldn’t 
resist. &nbsp;The beardee boys headed out for the smooother surroundings of the 
Beardee garden to top up the old tan and talk tactics for later.&nbsp; One query from 
one of the uninitiated was ‘Is the green flat?’&nbsp; An immediate retort from 
um-pie-r Ali Gee came back ‘It will be when Yuppers has been on it’.&nbsp; (Another 
tactic of course). &nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">Rob Belcher joined 
us to guide us through the Stafford everglades to the bowling club, and warnings 
were given out by Yuppers that he was a spie. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">At the bowling 
club the two teams were formally introduced to each other; curiously Rob’s team 
were also decked out in their own shirts complete with team logo “RBBC”.&nbsp; Many 
guesses were made as to the meaning of the shirt logo; repeatable ones being Rob 
Belchers Bowling Club and Rob Belchers Boozing Club.&nbsp; Although they were both 
wrong the Boozing club appeared to be more accurate than the original version of 
‘Rising Brook Boy’s Club’ by the end of the night.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">The teams were 
selected and names chalked up on the team bored (I am now!) and battle 
commenced.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">Col and Keithee 
made a fine start for the Squarrites taking an enormous lead of 8-1.&nbsp; But as 
they began to sober up the perspiring duo of Mick and John somehow summoned up 
enough strength to come in for the kill, and with a few lucky ends took the game 
11-8.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">Spikelet and 
Giblett were unlucky with a 9-12 defeat against Keith and Ron, although 
Giblett’s ten pin bowling action would surely have won the ‘nobowl’ prize if it 
were to have been awarded.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">Richee, in his 
smooth-bottomed dancing shoes, took the floor with partner Bolt from the Blue 
with a soft shoe shuffle. &nbsp;Mark and Eddie were however adjudged to have won the 
heat with marks awarded for presentation and some fine moves, waltzing in at 
8-5.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">A display of 
amazing skills was displayed by the Beardee, <s>handicapped</s> partnered, by 
Ali Gee from Neck-end.&nbsp; Used to hurling rocks Ali couldn’t quite get the hang of 
bowling lighter wooden bowls on the night, but together they thrashed George and 
Dennis 12-6.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">The first round 
over and it was time to send in the second wave. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">50/50, 60/40 and 
70/30, alias Craigee, Steve and Chris, settled into a fine rhythm after 
suffering the first hour sitting near to the barrels of ale, but picking up a 
few tips from watching the old wizard Beardee.&nbsp; It paid off as they made a 
marvellous draw against Bob and Chris, 9-9, or should it have been 50-50?</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">Brockie and Mo-Who 
were thrashed 13-6 by Nick and Barry.&nbsp; I can’t understand what went wrong 
there.&nbsp; I can only think that they were too polite to take advantage or that the 
distance they had travelled over the day had proved too much.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">Stubbee, only 
previously used to chucking, was assisted in the fine art of bowling by Granpop 
Billee, trafficking a fine draw 7-7 against Steve and Ian.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">Triglett pitched a 
few bowls around the green until Steve Machine explained it just wasn’t 
cricket.&nbsp; Trig confirmed he had been making a gate recently during his 
retirement and his wife had decided to make a bolt for it!!&nbsp; He was stumped.&nbsp; 
Dave and Karl came from under covers to just take the game 17-14.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">I’d like to say it 
was a gripping end to end match between Yup and Mid week Tone, and Robbee and 
his dad fast Eddy, but unfortunately there were no sparks flying, except for 
Rob.&nbsp; The eagle eyed Eddy had taught Robbee well and the secret tactics of 
moving Yup’s pint of ale in between ends and insisting the bowling match be 
organised on a Wednesday had upset Mid-week Tone and had obviously gone to plan.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">After much 
clanking of bowls and bowels, the results on the board showed a comprehensive 
defeat for Yuppers’ barmy army. &nbsp;Although the edited photographed evidence may 
show a different result, thanks to Spikelet.&nbsp; The final result of 6-1 failed to 
disguise the close run points score of 97-75 and the rub of the green.&nbsp; Other 
excuses included playing away from home, the bald patches on the green, the 
undulating, uneven and sloping areas, the lack of rain, and the missing 
experience of our absent bowlers including Dasher who had become a casualty only 
a day before the match.&nbsp; His hands had swollen after polishing his bowls for too 
long and now needed to get a grip of himself.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">With the exception 
of Beardee’s fine performance Yup’s ship had sunk. &nbsp;The weeks of training (well 
one quick session in a pub the week before) had failed to pay off, although it 
had come in handy when emptying the titanic boxes at the end of the night.&nbsp; The 
boxes of Iceberg and White Star had proved a tremendous success for the 
squarrites (more so than the bowling) and were ably sucked dry at the end by 
Richee and Ali Gee; after which it was time to make tracks to the curry house.
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">A long table had 
been laid out for us at the Malabar restaurant.&nbsp; The pappodoms were served 
immediately and the main courses, which had been previously been pre-ordered 
were bought out soon after.&nbsp; The service and food were superb.&nbsp; My ‘fairly hot’ 
Rezela tarkari was spot on.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">An excellent 
choice Rob, well chosen and thanks for placing the orders.&nbsp; All were impressed, 
especially Moonbeam who finished every last grain of rice before allowing the 
waiter to take his plate away at the third attempt.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">The bill was ably 
sorted out by the transport manager after asking around for a calculator.&nbsp; Moon 
Beam said he’d always had problems finding his calculator on his mobile, but he 
found it easy to download a picture of a cat!!&nbsp; Very useful in these situations.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">Finally it was 
home time.&nbsp; The squarrites assembled at the designated assembly point but there 
was no bus.&nbsp; It did eventually turn up half an hour late and it was good to see 
that the driver had managed to remain his happy jovial self. &nbsp;Craigee did take 
issue with his late coming and decided that he would issue a bowllocking.&nbsp; So, 
we had a situation where Craigee who was originally late, was now going to 
bowllock the bus driver for being late! &nbsp;mmhmm.&nbsp; The lot of a transport manager 
is not a happy one, me thinks. &nbsp;Fifty yards from the Stoke drop off the bus 
swerved under late instructions from hijackers; Craigee and Richee up to 
Penkhull, only to go back to Stoke, then Castle, via Penkhull again.&nbsp; By this 
time Keithee awarded himself the George cross valour and well deserved too.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">It had been a fine 
barmy sort of night with only a few drops of rain falling whilst we were in the 
restaurant.&nbsp; The Stafford gnats had been out and had taken great delight in 
nipping everyone especially Beardee who got a pearler on his temple.&nbsp; Or did he 
prick himself when orchestrating the sing-song on the coach back?</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">Congratulations 
and thanks must be given to every member of the Sparklers for making it such a 
memorable occasion and in particular Rob, his dad Eddy, and the Club for putting 
up with us.&nbsp; The night wasn’t really about winning (well we would say that now 
wouldn’t we?) but meeting another great set of guys.&nbsp; Keep the ‘DREGS’ cup 
polished chaps and in good condition please as we’ll be taking a closer look at 
it next year.&nbsp; Commiserations to my fine army of Squarrites who should be very 
proud of their first bowling performance.&nbsp; Here’s to the next time!</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">Cheers</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">Yupmeister and Ali 
Gee (a collaboration)</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">(enjoy yer baltis 
and yer pies)</span></p>
