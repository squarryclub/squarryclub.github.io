!!?:</SPAN></P>

<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Comic Sans MS">The old tiled floor, 
and the narrow door at the Wheatsheaf, Onneley, the cartoon characters, the fish 
behind the bar, and the ‘Joules’&nbsp; engraved in the glass window of the door 
at the Hinds Head at Norton-in-Hales.&nbsp; The elephants and the fresco at the 
Indian, on which the name and location of the Indian were superimposed were a 
dead give away.&nbsp; Only one squarrite eventually spotted the detail; young 
Sherlock Gee, but too late to amend his submitted guess.&nbsp; (The large white 
elephant was this year’s red herring of course).</SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Comic Sans MS"></SPAN>&nbsp;</P>
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Comic Sans MS">33½ squeezed onto a 
33 seater coach, with young Nige (no-el) hidden in the aisle. &nbsp;The 
Wheatsheaf staff were very accommodating with an army of young gals at the ready 
to tank us up with Black Sheep, Theakstones bitter and other mamby-pamby 
drinks.&nbsp; An hour later and we were entering the Hinds Head at Norton in 
Hales where an even greater selection of ales was available.&nbsp; Last calls 
were made in front of the cartoon festooned walls before jumping on the bus for 
the awards.&nbsp; An LTP award (in the form of a money box) was given to Mr 
Tahoohigh for being the ‘last to pay’ up for this year’s jaunt.&nbsp; It’s 
surprising he’s never received this one before??&nbsp; Chukkee was given a bag 
of Nobby's Nuts as there were no planters around this year!&nbsp; A urinal 
bottle was passed to Craigee, much to his relief, because the Yupmeister never 
takes the urine; and a magnifying glass was awarded to Ali Gee for his lengthy 
efforts in checking out the finer details in the clues.</SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</P>
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Comic Sans MS">Finally we came to 
the results of the mystery guesses and the mystery prize-giving:</SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Comic Sans MS">In third place was 
Silver Bear with Pizza Hut in Longton.&nbsp; I do worry about this young 
squarrite!&nbsp; In second place was Beardee with ‘A passage to India’ in 
Crewe.&nbsp; Lucky he didn’t meet us there as intended, but an excellent attempt 
anyway, linking the Indian connection with the Crewe railway station and the 
name of an Indian in Crewe.</SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Comic Sans MS">A tie for first 
place resulted in a draw having to be made between Sparky and Malc who had both 
opted for Nantwich.&nbsp; Red and green chillies were drawn from a balti dish at 
the front of the bus by Ronnie the driver.&nbsp; By default, Sparky was 
allocated the red chillies as he is a bit of a live wire.&nbsp; A green chillie 
was drawn and Malc Jay took the ‘No-Bell’ &nbsp;prize of £15.</SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Comic Sans MS"></SPAN>&nbsp;</P>
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Comic Sans MS">We arrived at the 
Jaipur in Market Drayton around 10 minutes early, just enough time for a quickie 
in the pub opposite.&nbsp; The ‘Indian connection’ clue was obviously Market 
Drayton’s famous son, Clive of India.&nbsp; An email was sent out with a ginger 
coloured background on one occasion as a clue to the gingerbread men the town is 
also famous for.&nbsp; Obvious aint it?.&nbsp; On return, we were directed 
upstairs and served up with the traditional pappodoms whilst drinks and food 
orders were taken.&nbsp; During the wait, a run down of this year’s trips was 
given by Yup and the Squarrite profiles were passed around.&nbsp; Glasses were 
raised and a toast was made to the Squarry club.&nbsp; Unfortunately, and as is 
occasionally the case with groups of this size, one or two had to wait longer 
than most and sadly a war of words broke out in some quarters.&nbsp; On the 
whole, the meal was excellent and great value for money at around £15 each, and 
the Indian would welcome most of us back.&nbsp; There was just time for a 
nightcap in the pub opposite and an opportunity for Phil (Fagin) Wok’n’Wol to 
unashamedly expose an item of glassware he had just nicked.</SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Comic Sans MS"></SPAN>&nbsp;</P>
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Comic Sans MS">Col broke out the 
ukulele on the return journey 
<a href="Colin.wav">(Click 
here for a rendition of 'She'll be coming round the mountain when she 
comes')</a> and Beardee stirred up the troops with a silver spoon before pulling 
himself into an upright position and presenting Yup with several bottles of 
Australian Merlot for his contributions throughout the year.&nbsp; Many thanks 
chaps.</SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Comic Sans MS"></SPAN>&nbsp;</P>
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Comic Sans MS">Here’s hoping next 
year’s mystery night goes as splendiferous as this years, and without 
mishap.</SPAN></P>
