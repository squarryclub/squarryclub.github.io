<p class="auto-style5">An emergency alternative was set up to Alsager across the 
border into Cheshire on Friday 31<sup>st</sup> January 2014 as a result of not 
being able to see any stars at Keele Observatory.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Taxis were arranged from the Westbury Tavern for the five hardy folk who 
attended; Yups, Anytime, Craigee, Bill and Dasher who braved the elements.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span><p class="auto-style5">
&nbsp;<p class="auto-style5">2 Pie Hard Dave was already in residence at the Lodge in Alsager waiting 
for the arrival of the merry crew.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>
The Lodge in Alsager most Squarrites will already know of because it is in the 
National Real Ale guide and has a considerable range of real ales on including 
the landlords own brews from his brewery round the back. (Goodall’s brewery).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Green Hop bitter proved to be a popular tipple for the night as we 
huddled in a corner in a very crowded pub, strangely full of people early 
evening of the same age range as ourselves.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

</span>It was the smell of burning flesh cos he was sitting too close to the 
fire.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>After throwing our precious 
beer on him to douse the flames he was none the worse for wear and we headed off 
to our next pub, all of 100 yards up the road, the Mere Inn.</span><o:p></o:p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p class="auto-style5">In 2 Pies formative years this pub was renowned for the 
anti-student stance against inmates from Alsager Teacher Training College.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>It served Greenalls for years and became very run down with residents in 
recent times complaining about the shed like outside smoking area being noisy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>It then closed down and was eventually bought by Joules formerly of Stone 
and now Market Drayton.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Glebe 
in Stoke is of the same family.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>

gentry of Alsager.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This hostelry 
has been gutted and been completely rebuilt in a new layout with an extension to 
the side where the smoking shed used to be and a patio area beer garden at the 
rear.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Very nice but it was remarked 
that the interior was rather dark with the effect of the heavy Georgian brick.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>We found a corner and also found the Somerset Levels in the loo.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Again the problem was there being not enough investment in flood defences 
and the infrastructure to support those flood defences.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Blame the Government!!.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="auto-style5">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="auto-style5">2 Pies was supposed to get up and do some photos in The 
Mere but declared that the scenarios were not arty farty enough. </p>

<p class="auto-style5">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="auto-style5">Finally we trudged 20 yards next door to the Indian 
Spice, a restaurant of some distinction in a town which had become saturated 
with all manner of fast food joints mainly because planning permission was never 
granted for any other use on the main road.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>We found the food to be very good.&nbsp; Steve declared that his was the best 
Indian he had ever had, the rest of the group was more muted on this topic.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The range of curries available and the prices were very reasonable.&nbsp; This 
is a restaurant obviously worth a second visit<o:p>.</o:p></p>
