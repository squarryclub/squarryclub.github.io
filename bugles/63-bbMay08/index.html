Nott’s Notes&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Friday 2<sup>nd</sup> May 2008</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The 
band of Merry Men in tights were Yup, Mid-week Tone, Pedro (Groucho??), Granpop 
Bill, Keithee’s up for it, JayCee, Dasher, DCeen, McCeen, and Twiglett</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">
<a href="https://baltibugle.co.uk/bugles/63-bbMay08/Nottingham/index.html">Click here for photos</a></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The 
train to Nottingham, home of Robin Hood, was bang on time.&nbsp; JayCee and Granpop 
Bill eagerly jumped on board to take advantage of the free seats with the extra 
leg room. A brief change at Derby and we soon alighted at Nottingham Station to 
be greeted by Squire Twiglett, whose darling wife Linda had dropped him off.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Mid 
week Tone, the real ale bard, had got the ale itinery sussed and led us to the 
first ale house, ‘CanalHouse’.&nbsp; ‘We’ll just barge in’, cracked Twiglett, as we 
strode over the wharf bridge below which a canal barge was housed.&nbsp; Things could 
only improve?</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">
Decisions, decisions, as we poured over the ales available.&nbsp; Bateman’s Valiant 
and brewer of the year, Castle Rock’s ales were chalked up.&nbsp; It was a warm sunny 
day, and advantage of the outside seating was taken.&nbsp; An ale house next door was 
also very tempting, and displayed a good selection of ales; but the outside 
seating wasn’t so appealing.&nbsp; The ‘crack’ was good, as noted by Dasher who had 
found somewhere he’d have loved to have parked his bike.&nbsp; But then you had to be 
facing the right way to take full advantage. &nbsp;Keithee, also had his eye on the 
crack, and forgot whose beer he was tasting, before Pedro made him aware he’d 
drank his pint.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Next to 
us, a young wench in tight denim jeans, a white tee shirt and long black hair, 
who we hadn’t noticed, approached Yup to look after her notes whilst she popped 
back to the bar for another pint. Well she would feel safe with them in Yup’s 
hands.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Shame 
we had to move on, but today’s outing was to give us a taster of the area for 
future visits when we could perhaps spend longer at our favourite haunts.&nbsp; The 
‘trip to Jerusalem’ wasn’t too long, surprisingly, and room was available 
between the ladies and the gents in the back yard. McManagerCeen rang to say 
he’d arrived at the station in his car, straight off a management course.&nbsp; A 
chorus of where’s yer glasses gone erupted as DCeen answered and managed to lose 
his specs.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">‘Little 
John’ and ‘Ye Olde Trip’ ales were available, which weren’t at their best.&nbsp; A 
discussion about whisky began as we waited for McCeen, culminating in a promised 
malt whisky trip to be organised by DCeen.&nbsp; McCeen finally managed to arrive and 
duly finished off JayCee’s pint for him before we moved on to meet Robin Hood 
himself.&nbsp; Keithee tried to wrestle the bow and arrow off him for JayCee to take 
home as a present for Andrew.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">We 
passed the ‘Castle’ pub which JayCee thought was nice, but as they didn’t have 
any decent ales on show we shot off in search of the next on the list, The Bell.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The 
Bell Inn was a cosy little city centre pub, selling ales black country ale 
including ‘Fireside’. The toilet was also cosy evidently, and was built for 
pygmies according to JayCee.&nbsp; Granpop Bill was particularly interested in the 
poster which declared that in 1812, William Clarke was the landlord of The Bell, 
renowned for opening the Trent Bridge cricket ground.&nbsp; Its boring youth.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Still 
reeling from his failure to finish his pint at the ‘Trip’ and being unable to 
get Robin’s bow and arrow, JayCee threw his pint over DCeen.&nbsp; Of course he 
blamed Mid-week Tone for the spillage, who was standing 4 feet away. &nbsp;DCeen 
though, was incredibly chilled, being more stressed out over the impending final 
Stoke match due to take place the following Sunday against Leicester.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Pedro, 
or should it be the hairy new look Gringo, was intrigued how Mid week Tone had 
found the pubs, to which Tone replied that he simply typed in CAMRA and 
Nottingham in his pc. &nbsp;JayCee said he’d tried that before but he just got 
Jessops.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">
Finally, a quick visit to Ye Olde Salutation Inn, the last before the Indian, 
where Triglett could thankfully make a dash to the designer toilettes.&nbsp; As we 
approached, a pigeon descended and dropped a present on DCeen’s jacket to match 
his damp shirt. An omen perhaps for the Sunday game.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">We 
crossed the road to be ‘4550 miles from Delhi’.&nbsp; A democratic decision was made 
to try the banquet at a special discounted rate of £17 fought triumphantly by 
Pedro.&nbsp; The food was good and plentiful with endless supplies being available.&nbsp; 
Several bottles of house wine were ordered and luckily nobody saw Yup spill his 
wine over the table before we left to catch the train, except for Dasher who 
apologised for the bill being slightly damp.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">In 
Derby we had just under an hour to lose at The Brunswick before the minibus was 
due to collect us from outside the railway station.&nbsp; Groucho tagged on to a 
couple of folk out for a quiet drink, before Keithee joined him and lost his 
memory.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Sadly 
we lost drinking time as the minibus had got lost somewhere in Derby. The driver 
and his minibus were new to the firm and when he finally arrived, three quarters 
of an hour later, he proceeded to circle a couple of roundabouts before finally 
taking the right route back to Stoke.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Night 
night</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Yuppers</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">(enjoy 
yer baltis)</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
