<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">The evening began 
with a buzz at Newcastle’s bus station around 6pm.&nbsp; The driver soon got the hang 
of the same ticket requests, ‘I’ll go wherever he’s going, thanks.&nbsp; Do you sell 
returns?’&nbsp; A convoluted tour around several estates followed with us taking up 
the seats at the front of the bus.&nbsp; At one stop we picked up a guy on crutches 
who squeezed awkwardly between us to find an empty seat at the rear of the bus, 
mumbling something about seats for disabled which some gits were occupying.&nbsp; A 
young lass also squeezed on and pushed a pram amongst us.&nbsp; The baby took to 
JayCee and offered him a sweet.&nbsp; He refused of course.&nbsp; ‘Never take a sweet from 
a stranger’, he declared.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">As we arrived at The 
Plough, a haze of blue flashing lights lit the sky.&nbsp; A fight had erupted in the 
bar earlier which had now thankfully calmed down.&nbsp; Quiet place Bignal End!&nbsp; The 
main instigator had been restrained and was being questioned by the men in blue 
outside the pub as he mopped the streaming blood from his brow.&nbsp; Trepadaciously, 
we crossed the road after jumping off the bus, and entered The Plough with 
slight caution but raging thirsts.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">It was a while 
before some of us got served, acceptably of course, but the Skinners’ – 
‘Splendid tackle’ was finally poured and was well worth the wait.&nbsp; Beardee’s 
brave attempted appearance failed after he’d earlier endured a trip to the 
dentist’s chair, with the loss of blood being too much to bear. Mr Tahoohigh, 
however, did turn up eventually after sitting outside the pub for half an hour, 
traumatised by the commotion.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">The following months 
outing to Brum was mentioned and Utterly announced he sadly wouldn’t be around 
for it. He was off to Marrakesh and Vietnam, not at the same time obviously, but 
would carry out a scouting mission for a future squarrite event.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">As time was limited, 
we moved on swiftly to the ‘Mucky Duck’ (Black Swan) where Oakham’s JHB was on 
tap.&nbsp; Dasher spotted pork pies at the bar and graciously returned with several 
big buggers and a sharp knife, as several slobbering squarrites looked on.&nbsp; 
Mmmmm.&nbsp; Granpop Bill and ‘Keithee’s up for it’ were most grateful after missing 
out on a promised Wright’s pie after work which they’d been working their selves 
up to.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">Thornbridge Wild 
Swan, Abbeydale Moonshine, and some dark beer which Granpop Bill discovered were 
available.&nbsp; Matt ‘Silver Bear’ and Chris ‘Axe’ finally turned up, completing the 
numbers for the evening.&nbsp; Talking pies turned to health issues and Jaycee 
explained how recently he’d seen big black globules drop across his eyes during 
a meeting and had experienced a curtain effect.&nbsp; There’s nothing unusual in this 
though we thought.&nbsp; It was a county wounty wollers bored meeting after all.&nbsp; 
With that in mind we pulled ourselves together ready to move on.&nbsp; However, a 
suggestion to stay put and miss out on the beer fest at the football club, was 
raised by Dasher and swiftly seconded. Joe’s watch was still on summer time who 
had assumed we had got hours to spare. The beer festival, for now though, would 
have to wait for another year.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">The wallets came out 
for more beer and ye olde ‘Where’s yer wallet gone’ rang out, bringing back 
happy memories of DCeen’s experience in Prague.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">Axe gave an 
impressive demonstration of how to pump a rifle which we would need to carry out 
when we go clay pigeon shooting later in the year, but got that excited we 
thought he’d shot his load.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">‘Another half then 
before the curry’, suggested Utterly, who unfortunately was going to miss out on 
his first experience of the Audley beer festival.&nbsp; ‘Oh go on then’. . . . . . . 
. .</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">After a ten minute 
walk we bagged some delightful wines from the offie, before entering the New 
Royal Balti.&nbsp; As usual the service and meal was excellent.&nbsp; ‘The nan breads were 
exquisite’, commented JayCee as he recalled the thrill of rolling the biggest 
cherry ever around his mouth.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">It’s mostly a blur 
now but it was a cracking night and at only £13 each, fantastic value.&nbsp; The 
return journey was bumpy but at least we’d all made it back in one piece.&nbsp; 
Here’s to next year’s festival !!</span></p>
