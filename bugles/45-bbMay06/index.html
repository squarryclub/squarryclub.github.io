<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">13 made it, 
including the late arrival of the sat navs; Argumentative Aide and Crafty.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">Yup, Keithee’s up 
for it, JayCee, Dasher, Stubbee, Bolt from the Blue, Argumentative Aide and 
Crafty Keith, Mid-week Tone, </span>
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">DCeen and McCeen, 
Malc Jay and Pedro.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">1 o’clock and the 
message seeped through that the sat navs, Ade and Crafty, were going to be late 
again.&nbsp; Yes, unbelievably, Ade had gone on site at the last minute and was 
having difficulty finding his way back to the office.&nbsp; Did his Porsche break 
down??</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">The queue at the 
stoke station ticket desk was a mile long, so we trialled the fast ticket 
machines.&nbsp; Keithee, stroking his cloth cap and whippet, went through the saga of 
inserting his card and requesting a return ticket to Brum to show us how easy it 
was.&nbsp; After 20 attempts he realised he’d got no credit in his account and 
abandoned his quest.&nbsp; The picture of Keithee in his cloth cap would have been a 
stunner but sadly the old camera battery was as flat as his cap.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">On the train, and 
sitting at different areas, Stubbee sat drooling with his hands fumbling under 
the table, with a huge grin on his face.&nbsp; 100% bollocks he was heard to mutter.&nbsp; 
Ah, what a relief.&nbsp; It was later discovered he was texting his wife on his 
mobile and confirming the pie he was hoping to devour later.&nbsp; Another photo 
opportunity had gone to waste, so a determined effort to recharge it somehow 
came top of the list.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">Jessops (Behold, 
Jessops is mentioned) came to Yup’s rescue, well a young lady in Jessops 
actually, who kindly agreed to charge it up, with no charge!, while we attempted 
to find and eventually slurp at The W’Anchor in Digbeth.&nbsp; Sorry, the Big Brother 
tourettes syndrome slipped out there.&nbsp; The Anchor has been featured in the 
latest CAMRA mags, and as luck had it, they’d got a mini beer fest on this week 
just for us!! &nbsp;Not the most salubrious, but a wonderful find none the less.&nbsp; 
DCeen knew the area well from his earlier days selling his wares on each street 
corner, but the less said about the better.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">Cards were issued at 
the pub and a stamp was put on it for every so many pints purchased.&nbsp; Getting 
the cards stamped proved tricky however.&nbsp; Somehow we managed to receive several 
cards, but each with only a couple of stamps on them.&nbsp; Combined, we may have got 
a dozen free pints, but somehow, only a couple of free pints were claimed.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">Ade and Crafty 
finally arrived in Brum and were directed through the streets of Digbeth to join 
us without the sat navs.&nbsp; We couldn’t leave them now that they’d finally landed, 
so we had to have another pint just to be sociable of course, chosen from the 
many different choices adorning a huge blackboard.&nbsp; Many of Mr Tahoohigh’s 
favourites were displayed on the board so we rang him to antagonise him but he 
was on site, allegedly.&nbsp; No doubt he was in the Plough.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">The locals warned us 
not to eat at the w’Anchor, oops, there it goes again; so Dasher and Malc Jay 
had sausage butties!! &nbsp;To give them credit they didn’t half look good.&nbsp; Time was 
running out, so the scheduled stop for food at the Church Inn at St Pauls got 
kicked in the head.&nbsp; So, we had another pint, and listened to Jaycee who 
recalled his run in, or ‘runs’ in, with the SAS, the unfriendly American ‘Sore 
Arse Security’ officers who body searched him at custom control in the big 
apple. &nbsp;Jaycee had endured the runs for several days.&nbsp; Evidently, they rummaged 
through his pants whilst they stood him up against a wall but they didn’t find 
anything!!&nbsp;&nbsp; With runny bottoms in mind we ran back through the City Centre, via 
Jessops and the runny ice cream van to Snow Hill station, eerrrhhhh.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">With only one pub 
attempted and 2 hours gone, Pedro was grumbling again.&nbsp; He at least added that 
they were only comments.&nbsp; How relieved I felt!!&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">After some confusion 
at Snow Hill we ended up buying ‘Daytripper’ tickets which happened to be also 
valid for the later jaunt to Tipton.&nbsp; The itinery was quickly reviewed and 
Bilston Central was agreed to be the only stop time would allow.&nbsp; Dasher was 
first off the train with Malc Jay and before mugging an old soldier obtained 
directions to the Old White Rose, just a hundred yards or so away.&nbsp; There was 10 
pence off a pint for CAMRA members.&nbsp; Whose round had it to be then lads?&nbsp; Mid 
week Tone and Pedro suddenly had many friends.&nbsp; I can’t remember the ales here 
so if anyone can jog my memory please shout.&nbsp; Time, wasn’t on our side 
unfortunately, so we set off again back to the Metro and off to Wolverhampton.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">A swift change from 
one station to another in Wolverhampton saw us on our way to Tipton.&nbsp; After 
passing the shopping centre which was deader than Neck-end on a Saturday night, 
Desperate John sprinted ahead in search of the toilets at the Mad O’Rourkes pie 
factory, with memories of his time with the SAS fresh in his mind</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">Mad O’Rourkes had 
the typical west midlands spit and sawdust appearance.&nbsp; Lumphammer was the main 
ale available along with Cumberland ale.&nbsp; Crafty embarked on the lager!!</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">A platter starter of 
black pudding, garlic mushrooms and chicken wings was shared by Ade and Crafty, 
but was eventually tasted by all and sundry before the main event began.&nbsp; The 
Desperate Dan Cow Pies, complete with horns, were served out to the men amongst 
us, whilst the wimps (mentioning no names) went for either the ‘Daisy Potter 
Pie’ [Crafty], the Ruby Murray pie [Bolt &amp; D Ceen/McCeen], the Wham Bam thank 
you lamb [Mid week T], or the ‘Barrymore Pie’ (faggots and peas)[Dashing].&nbsp; 
Stubbee’s bullocks posed no threat and no doubt he could have gone on to devour 
a couple of Ali Gees pork pies if they’d only been available.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">Jay Cee tried to get 
saucy with our waitress Janet, but the HP bottle did nothing for her.&nbsp; She 
awarded him with a Wimps certificate, not because of his efforts with the pie, 
but because he took his Viagra tablets with a J<sup>2</sup>O.&nbsp; Ade and Crafty 
also failed to impress her by sinking bottles of Smirnoff Ice.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">Ade left early along 
with Crafty to prepare a luncheon meat feast for his slippery friends, and we 
all followed soon after settling up with miss grumpy drawers who accused us of 
avoiding a Daisy.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">Back in 
Wolverhampton a small breakaway party explored the Tap &amp; Spile whilst the old 
uns went home to bed.&nbsp; The Summer Lightening proved to be on top form, whilst 
the untouched Landlord did nothing for Jay Cee who was now feeling low after 
Janet’s brush off.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">A deserted rucksack 
on the footway, cordoned off by the police, gave a stark reminder of the perils 
of modern day city life.&nbsp; This was followed by a gaggle of girls who bellowed 
‘awright boys’ in a Wolverhampton dialect, as we passed them on route back to 
the station.&nbsp; We thought our luck was in until sadly, we realised we couldn’t 
get past their guide dogs.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">So at last the pie 
and metro experience was over.&nbsp; There promises to be less dashing and more ale 
next time we return, culminating in a visit to the Bilash in Wolverhampton.&nbsp; I 
can’t wait to get back to proper grub.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">Yup</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">(Enjoy yer baltis)</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">PS Anyone up for the 
minutes at Stone??</span></p>
