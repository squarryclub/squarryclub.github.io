Many were �Up for it�, but both familiar and unfamiliar drop outs left the following stalwarts:<br>
Yup, MWTone, Pedro, Lionel Richee, Keithee�s up for it, Mad Jacko, 50/50 Craigee, Fingers of Steel Scottee and guest appearances from the Rochdale cowboy; Mo Who, with his colleague Sean of the dead.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Following Ali Gee�s recommendations a trip to Liverpool was finally arranged. Pity after all this time he was unable to join us. Did he know something we didn�t?<br>
&nbsp;<br>
The slightly delayed 13.18 train from Stoke to Crewe made its connection with Jacko and Huge at Crewe; arriving in Liverpool an hour and a half later. It�s obviously we�re nearing retirement age as we discussed the fact that no group discounts were available for this route and that relatively speaking the trip from Crewe to Liverpool was cheap in comparison to the full journey from Stoke. As we stood winging about costs, station announcements bellowed out over the platform by the familiar Kev from Supreme in his new job; �Der train arrivein on platform tnoo is der dree dirtee from dottingam�. Fingers of steel Scottee was highly amused.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
The Victorian style Dr Duncan�s in Queens Square was just a 5 minute walk from Lime Street Station which was by far one of the biggest and impressive stations we�d previously experienced.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Dr Duncan�s is the main outlet for Cains ales in Liverpool, evidently having around 700 guest ales on in the last 12 months. Its name commemorates Dr Duncan, a relentless campaigner against poor living conditions in Liverpool during the Victorian era. Bit of history there!!<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Huge leapt onto the footrest to get some height at the bar and managed to call the first round in before the rush. Mo finally arrived, cap in hand, after dodging the rain drops, and managed a half before being rushed on to the next pub; The Lion Tavern. Pedro sank his teeth into a toffee flavoured �Mendip Mammoth� whilst the Copper Dragon�s �Golden Pippin� was on top form for most others. The Lion is famous for its cheeseboards and pie lunches but sadly we were out of luck today. Luckily giant pork pies were spotted behind the bar by Keithee who set about ordering several sliced pies to be distributed around. Pedro bought a pie to take home as a present just in case there were no after eight mints at the Indian. Lucky he did really.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
A scouser popped his head through the door to ask if anyone wanted a close shave. JC turned him down as he�d just had one. He had gone to check out the splashguard in the men�s toilets, and was spotted emerging from the ladies, red faced. Oops.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
As we stuffed the pies and mustard down our gullets we made several attempts to contact Ali Gee to share our experience with him, but we had no luck. He was obviously having a power nap in the site cabin.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
It was a bit stuffy in the bar with us lot crammed in, so we enquired if there was any air conditioning. Another local scouser quickly obliged and opened the front door.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
We waited till 5.15 for the free cheese samples to be dished out before moving on to have a quick gander at the Cavern, and passing an unusual architectural feature with a section of the building continuously rotating. Click here for video<br>
&nbsp;<br>
As we passed a few locals, JC broke into song, �Where�s yer shell suit gone? Where�s yer shell suit gone�, so we had to carm him down, �Carm down, carm down�.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Outside the Cavern we had a group shot (no pun intended) with John Lennon before stepping down into the famous cellar for 2 minutes of live music. Jacko stated that he was quite happy not to have a drink, but we didn�t believe him.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
There would be no time to call into the White Star as time was running out. So we made our way to the Baltic Fleet, the liver birds were pointed out by Jacko and the large towers which were exhaust chimneys for the tunnel. Amazing what we learn on these trips. Scottee, Craigee and Richee went their separate way to spot more liver birds as we continued on to the Baltic.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
A delightful pint was savoured by most except for JC who was on a diet. He went for a J2O and a lager, finishing both (yes!) before leaving for the Passage to India.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
As time was short, we sped back through the city and found the Passage to India in Bold Street which had been booked for 7pm. Mo�s work colleague, Sean of the dead, was patiently waiting for us, and managed to put up with us babbling on throughout the meal. As we took our seats we counted up and the realisation that we had lost one of the party dawned on us. Pedro had gone awol. Several calls later and we tracked him down at Lime St station. Scoffing his pork pie he was adamant he was going home despite the requests to rejoin us. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
The Indian was very good from everyone�s recollections, although no details could be recounted. It had obviously been a rewarding day out again.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Return was 21.40 via Stafford station. Richee declared it had been a fairly entertaining day. <br>
