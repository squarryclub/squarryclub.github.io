met up at the Glebe in Stoke except Zolette and John Hotdog Carter who would 
meet us later.&nbsp; Once we'd convened we were led round to Stoke's Train 
station where a London Midland train was caught in a south westerly direction.&nbsp; 
Spread out over a couple of carriages all eyes were on the Yupmeister to see 
where we'd be getting off.&nbsp; Jumping off at Lichfield Trent Valley came as 
no surprise to many who had voted for it as the final destination.&nbsp; Would 
they be correct??&nbsp; Sadly, the train connection to the City Station appeared 
to disappear off the departure board so a mile long walk became the only option 
remaining.&nbsp; Zolette appeared as though from nowhere to join us, having 
endured a 4 hour journey to join us.</td>
