<p>(Scottie let us down, but he was forgiven for being on pre honeymoon duty in
Cyprus)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Arriving just after 6pm the queue had already stretched to around 50 yards or
so. 3 tiers of casks were on this year racked on both sides of the town hall
walls, with a selection of foreign and English bottles upstairs.</p>
<p>Vouchers at the ready we quickly split up in search of our favorite ales in
different directions. Craigee 50/50 and Richee Fred Astaire must have thought it
was a real cider festival and proceeded to fill their glasses with ye olde
cider. Craigee 50/50’s appeared to be a clear strong cider at 8.4% or
thereabouts but Richee F’Astaire said it was only tap water. Strong stuff ye
old trent water must be! Granpop Bill reacted by taking off in the opposite
direction in search of dark beers most of which he’d pre-selected from the
programme for the evening.</p>
<p>Jay C Wolla plumped for the Cherry Bomb, without taking advice from the rest
of us Camra experts who had previously tasted it and spat it out. He’d already
got an aftertaste in his mouth having been accosted by Pete Thorley over a
proposed pedestrian crossing at Seabridge. Never mix work with pleasure, or
Cherry Bomb with decent ale.</p>
<p>‘D Ceen my wallet’ produced his 7<sup>th</sup> mobile of the year and
took a few snaps of hunky squarrites in between slurps. Barry (Tone’s bro’-in-law)
appeared to have his head bowed most of the evening (obviously realising who I
was….). We later found out he hadn’t, nor was he depressed, but he had found
several lost drink tokens on the floor and was still looking for more.</p>
<p>As the clock ticked away several of the free vouchers were handed out in
anticipation that they would be handed in to the charity appeal on display
around the hall as we left. It wasn’t to be. ‘D Ceen my wallet and McCeen my
student grant’ duly cashed in their tokens for cash and snapped up 2 copies of
the latest real ale guide. Obviously they were both out to gleam a clue or two
for the mystery curry nite in December.</p>
<p>The Boneshakers began to warm up indicating it was time to go. Jay C Wolla
passed on a comment to D Ceen my wallet, made by the County Wollers regarding
taxi fares in Prague and D Ceen my wallet politely replied that he’d look into
it.</p>
<p>The tables at the Rose had to be swiftly re arranged from 8 to 11 to allow
for the extra strugs we’d picked up on our way. An excellent meal and service
as usual. A chicken tikka and hot chillie nan bread was produced by request and
proved to be a winner. Bill was passed a sample and downed it without noticing.</p>
<p>Our resident wino expert Trigglet, turned monster, immediately beckoned the
wine waiter over and put the world to rights by having the house wine replaced
with a decent bottle of Jacobs Creek………..then another…….then another……They
might have their own web site but they can’t fool us with their cheap wine!!</p>
<p>2 taxis duly arrived under request by the proprietor and we escaped into the
night accompanied by a hoard of young wenches who appeared like a Phoenix to
share a lift to Castle.</p>
