<div style="font-family:'.SF NS Text';font-size:15px;color:#000000;">
<div><span style="font-family:'Comic Sans MS';font-size:16px;">30th July - Jaycee's Jolly July Jaunt</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span style="font-family:'Comic Sans MS';font-size:16px;">It was a fairly early start with the majority meeting up at Tittensor where a beautiful display of flowers and watering cans had been especially provided for us.&nbsp;The rain didn't dampen spirits as once we were at Jaycee's new home in the rural hamlet of Groundslow, a marquee provided shelter in the garden. </span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span style="font-family:'Comic Sans MS';font-size:16px;">A box of&nbsp;Foundation Stone ale was provided along with a good selection of bottles. Pork pies, sausage rolls, quiche and cheese were also in abundance.&nbsp;No doubt Carol had a hand in their preparation, so thankyou Carol... &nbsp;Besides the bungalow and the garden, the heat pump was also was of prime interest along with the built in bat sites.&nbsp;</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span style="font-family:'Comic Sans MS';font-size:16px;">A 20 minute walk back to Tittensor and we waved Pedro off who was returning home, before we caught the Stafford bus.&nbsp;It was only&nbsp;5 minutes to Slaters but unfortunately it was closed until 4. Hogarth&rsquo;s craft ale house was handy so we piled in but were disappointed with a very limited choice of ales; mainly Pedigree, Doombar and Wainwright&rsquo;s despite the lowest prices of the day.&nbsp;</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span style="font-family:'Comic Sans MS';font-size:16px;">The Shrewsbury Arms was therefore chosen for the next stop where by chance Sparklet, (Rob Belcher for those who don't know him) was enjoying a quiet moment settled in a corner.&nbsp;</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span style="font-family:'Comic Sans MS';font-size:16px;">Next stop an outside covered area at Candid where a mixture of ales were ordered. Richee made his appearance with suggestions for a future Squarry do quickly recommending that Craigee would arrange it.&nbsp;The Picture House had recently been refurbished after the floods so it was only right that we popped in for a while.&nbsp;</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span style="font-family:'Comic Sans MS';font-size:16px;">The old and trusted Bengal Lounge welcomed us in and led us upstairs. It was unlicensed but fear not, as MC shot off to the local offie for a few packs of lager. Excellent service and food and full marks for ensuring we were out and off to catch our trains and buses around 8ish.&nbsp;Jaycee made it home as his sensations began to manifest into very real and painful movements.&nbsp;</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span style="font-family:'Comic Sans MS';font-size:16px;">Thanks for organising Jaycee and for your hospitality.</span></div>
