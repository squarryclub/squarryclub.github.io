<div style="font-family:'.SF NS Text';font-size:15px;color:#000000;">
<div><span style="font-family:'Comic Sans MS';font-size:16px;">Off the Rails with Nails -&nbsp;A&nbsp;Cheshire Rail Ale Trip on Friday 15th October 2021.</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span style="font-family:'Comic Sans MS';font-size:16px;">Nails opened up his chic new bachelors pad for viewing on the way to the station, laying on bacon butties and teas. What a star. </span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span style="font-family:'Comic Sans MS';font-size:16px;">We left Stoke at 1113&nbsp;&nbsp;arriving in Chelford at 1208 via Crewe, picking up the rest of the group on the way.&nbsp; &nbsp;A short stroll of around 10 mins to Egerton Arms was almost too much for Sean, but the reward was worth it. &nbsp;Mothy realised his pre-purchased train tickets were for Holmes Chapel and not Cheadle Hulme so quickly booked a further ticket online. The conductors were hot on today so its as well he bought the extra ticket before embarking. &nbsp;Oracle was immediately spotted and ordered but it became clear (or not) it was the end of the barrel. The Lady Ravenscroft was next to run out but a fresh barrel was soon set up.&nbsp; &nbsp;Meals were paid for separately as some had already paid. A couple of extra halves were mysteriously consumed and somehow got added to the Squarr e-card.&nbsp; </span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span style="font-family:'Comic Sans MS';font-size:16px;">We made it back to Chelford Station in time for the 1408 to Cheadle Hulme and The Chiverton Tap. &nbsp;The drinks list at The Tap was extensive and served as the doorway to the toilets; confusing everyone except Yup who didn&rsquo;t need them.&nbsp; A &lsquo;Long Hop&rsquo; (cask) along with &lsquo;300 Laps of Your Garden&rsquo; (keg) was enough to make us legless.&nbsp; &nbsp;As we were leaving someone cheekily asked the question &lsquo;What has Stoke ever done for us?&rsquo;.&nbsp; Robbie Williams, pottery, spitfire and lung cancer were amongst the responses.&nbsp; &nbsp;Huge left his glasses case behind but luckily time wasn&rsquo;t important as there was some confusion over the time of the anticipated train. </span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span style="font-family:'Comic Sans MS';font-size:16px;">It seemed train times had changed since the reckie 2 years ago &nbsp;Whilst Nails pondered on what action to take Turk dug out Diggers crumpled sausage roll from his bag. A reserve snack to be consumed if the soup didn&rsquo;t satisfy his hunger, which it obviously hadn&rsquo;t. &nbsp;Quickly resolved we caught alternative trains to Holmes Chapel via Wilmslow.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span style="font-family:'Comic Sans MS';font-size:16px;">Another ten minutes walk to the Old Red Lion. The range was limited so we moved on to the Bottle Bank across the road after just one but only after the mix-up over a party booking was resolved. &nbsp;Several cask ales and kegs were available.&nbsp; &nbsp;DC performed admirably by throwing a grenade into the conversation about pensions with Digger defending police pensions before it was time to head off to Crewe on the 5.45 train.</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span style="font-family:'Comic Sans MS';font-size:16px;">The Passage to India was booked for 6.15pm.&nbsp; &nbsp;Goosey curry was cold, temperature-wise but spicy hot. Most were spot on. However,&nbsp;Corky had a while to wait for his prawns whilst some had very spicy hot curries, namely Nails and DC. The waiters were told&nbsp; in no uncertain terms that they were incompetent. They replaced DCs southern Indian curry with a bhuna which blew the inside of his mouth apart. His nan was cold and had to be replaced and eventually the correct rices were provided. </span><span style="font-family:'Comic Sans MS';font-size:16px;">&#128514;</span><span style="font-family:'Comic Sans MS';font-size:16px;"> &nbsp;Those who had drank extra cobras or above average priced curries graciously supplemented the shortfall to settle the bill as the kitty was emptied. Could this be a new trend? &nbsp;Despite numerous pleas for a tip none was given.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span style="font-family:'Comic Sans MS';font-size:16px;">The Stoke and Uttoxeter train left at 9.20 leaving Keithee time to top up before catching his bus home.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span style="font-family:'Comic Sans MS';font-size:16px;">Thanks for your hospitality Nails and for organising a great day out, and last but not least, Goosey for washing up the breakfast dishes.</span></div>
