<div style="font-family:'.SF NS Text';font-size:15px;color:#000000;">
<div><span style="font-family:'Comic Sans MS';font-size:16px;">13th August - Stone with Tone</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span style="font-family:'Comic Sans MS';font-size:16px;">There were 18 in total in the final group who made the effort; namely - &nbsp;Yup, Nails, Keithee, Bolt, Bill, Huge, Jaycee, DC, Phil, Tim, Tony, Turk,&nbsp; Richee, Jacko, Pedro, Sean, Craigee and a rather deflated Rob B.</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span style="font-family:'Comic Sans MS';font-size:16px;">Skivers - Brolly opted for a round of golf. Sid caught Covid. Digger caught baby snatching, sorry babysitting. Dark side was kept in the dark. Ali G was travelling yet again, and Dasher and Deb skipped off to Skipton celebrating their anniv.&nbsp; Where&rsquo;s Corky many have asked&hellip;..</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span style="font-family:'Comic Sans MS';font-size:16px;">Bus or train as usual to the Limestone Brewery Tap &ldquo;The Borehole&rdquo; about 14:00.&nbsp; &nbsp;Thankfully pork pies were available to satisfy Yup who&rsquo;d missed out on the Wrights pie shop. &nbsp;The Squarr e-card proved to be a pain as the pin was needed for most of the transactions. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span style="font-family:'Comic Sans MS';font-size:16px;">We moved on to the Crown Wharf at about 15:30; the new Joules pub (pronounced Jowels or Jewels depending on where you come from). &nbsp;A very impressive&nbsp; and no doubt expensive recently completed building with too many roof bolts according to the Structural Engineers amongst us.&nbsp; However the sausage rolls provided free gratis tasted better than the beer though according to Goosey and DC..&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span style="font-family:'Comic Sans MS';font-size:16px;">Next and final pub stop was the Swan Inn from 17:00 where we filled the back yard as usual. &nbsp;</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span style="font-family:'Comic Sans MS';font-size:16px;">Around 18:30 we moved to Mojo&rsquo;s. &nbsp;Keithee was very resilient to offers of wine from Craigee and Richee but drooled continuously throughout his meal.&nbsp; Strangely Craigee and bolt were rat arsed. &nbsp;As we left after a fab meal DC couldn&rsquo;t help but rant at the young waiter who knew more about curry!!&nbsp; It was definitely vindaloo&hellip;&hellip;.. &nbsp;So it appeared he lost his rag and also his mask which he failed to wear on the bus. &nbsp;</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span style="font-family:'Comic Sans MS';font-size:16px;">The 101 bus service back to Newcastle at 20:42 was virtually on time thankfully, as it was a race to get home for Jaycee. &nbsp;On the way back Huge got bushwacked, arguing with some brambles at the open air toilet at Stone station. &lsquo;Must have been Pedro's loud shirt that caused my pupils to dilate, hence loss of sight and footing&rsquo; he declared. &nbsp;</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span style="font-family:'Comic Sans MS';font-size:16px;">Thanks for organising Tone</span></div>
