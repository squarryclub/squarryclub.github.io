<p class="MsoNormal"><u>Squarrites up for it:</u>&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>Yupmeister, JayCee Wolla, D Ceen my wallet, Plumber Granpop
Bill, Mid week Tone, Ali Gee and R Geebargee, Richee F’Astaire, Keith (always
on for it), Joe Tahoohigh, Pedro, Triglett and Matt (better late than never),
Ian Lowe (a terrier I hear).&nbsp; Beardie of course let us down, feigning
illness and seeking sympathy.</i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">This was to be Pedro’s finest hour.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>After all his organising, the trip, using our very own first buses, was
finally underway.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>The troops slowly mustered at the bus station in Newcastle.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Plumber Granpop Bill arrived just in time after having plumbing problems.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>No, not the obvious fact that his washer had let him down, but that
he’d only just had time to down one pint in the Bulls Vaults, before meeting
us at the station.&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">5 minutes to go, and the Gees hadn’t arrived.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Was the stage-coach from neck-end going to let them down again.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The telegraph wires were red hot with messages pleading with us to delay
the bus from leaving, so every conceivable delaying tactic was used including
paying the fares in pennies.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>No
change there.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Finally, by the skin
of their teeth they arrived.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Shaken
but not stirred they jumped aboard paying their £3 ‘all-in’ fee for what
was going to be another mystery tour through Silverdale which looked remarkably
like a neck-end war zone.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Much to
the annoyance of the natives we had managed to take over all the seats on the
bus.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Pedro took up pole position by
the driver to direct proceedings.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>After
all, he had managed to get a copy of the bus timetables,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>….. eventually,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>and
so far everything was running like clockwork.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">But, where was the beer festival?<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The barrels were hidden surely.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Just the usual taps on the bar and a pool table in the back room could be
seen.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Not deterred we beckoned the
bar maids and began our expert investigations to see what was on offer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Most of the best ales had been supped the night before by our one and
only Tahoohie and his family leaving us with the dregs, which admittedly
improved as the night wore on.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Richee
F’Astaire took no chances and stuck by a Guinness or two.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The JHB Oakhams I was reliably informed was average; the Downtown October
was flat and dragged into November.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Ian
the terrier soon settled in and began his first lessons in becoming a squarite,
along with local lad Matt, the second youngest squarrite to Argee Bargee.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I swapped my Mr Harry for a dark Rumpus with Plumber
Granpop Bill, that had him swooning again over the Prague trip and pining for
dark ale from the monastery.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Keith (always on for it) brushed past Plumber Granpop Bill
a couple of times uttering ‘scuze me son’.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Joe was all white, as he brushed up against the blackboard erasing all
memories of his previous nights fun and games with Karen.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Even I had to remind him he’d forgotten my pint as he returned without
from the bar.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We were obviously getting merry, especially Pedro, as the
landlady vied her chances and flogged him 20 raffle tickets.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Realising he was now skint and he wouldn’t be getting a round in, we
slipped out to pole position to oooh and aarrhhh at the neck end firework
displays which he’d pre-arranged.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Probably
as well that Beardie wasn’t with us cus the bangs and loud noises would have
frightened him to death, in the state he’s in.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Waiting for the bus we were also entertained with
spectacular bonfires from a couple of miles away, which JayCeeWoller boasted he
could put out from where he stood, after having necked the best part of two
pints.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">5 minutes later we were in the offie purchasing beers and
wine at bargain prices.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Our supreme
wino, Triglett, offered his expert advice and Matt kept a low profile to ensure
we didn’t embarrass him on his local stamping ground.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>A 5 minute wait as the tables were reshuffled and the baltis
and trad pappadoms were ordered, with one or two noticeable exceptions of
course.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>What a surprise.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The meals were as exceptional as ever.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>With the exception of JayCee Wolla, who came over all queer and meandered
outside like a Spikelet, and Plumber Granpop Bill, who blamed a dicky Double
Dragon, we all wolfed our baltis.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Rgee
Bargee was seen to be polishing his bowl like Oliver.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Ali Gee obviously doesn’t feed him enough.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Time to go, and the bus was bang on time again.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>There’s a first for everything.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Splitting
into different directions we said our goodbyes, as best we could.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Wine bottle in hand, (my hand), some of us headed back to Castle.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Mid Week Tone had drunk too much but not enough to prevent him
remembering leaving unopened bottles of ale on the table.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Triglett had also drunk too much and left half a bottle of wine on the
table which Keith took full advantage of. Couldn’t have been a good choice
after all?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Plumber Granpop Bill was
still pining for Prague as we walked the final furlong through Clayton, and
cursing the effect the evil Double Dragon was beginning to have on his stomach.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
