<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">Numbers ‘up for it’ 
fluctuated on the run in to the biggest squarree event of the year hovering 
between 37 at one stage and 30 as the sat nav group dropped out with only hours 
to go.&nbsp; Moonbeam’s conscience finally got the better of him as he elected to 
visit Lichfield Cathedral instead and McCeen readily took his place.&nbsp; Ali Gee 
abstained with a dozen abscesses whilst RGBargee ate his pies for him; and the 
lowest of the Lowe studied his options and almost managed his first venture of 
the year, but failed.&nbsp; With only minutes to spare Mr Tahoohigh made a desperate 
direct line call to his brother-in-law, Tony Morethan, who boosted the numbers 
back up to 31, after taking out a travel insurance policy for the night.&nbsp; </span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">This year the start 
time and pick up points were changed, beginning at 5pm at The Westbury and 
5.15pm at Harry’s.&nbsp; Ronnie, our no1 mystery coach driver, turned up almost on 
time and Yup jumped on board to give him directions and discuss arrangements.&nbsp; 
Despite the frantic efforts of Ronnie, his buggered tape player wouldn’t work 
and even efforts to switch buses on route with a machine that worked failed.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">Keithee gathered the 
Harry’s bar contingency together and led them out into Kingsway as the bus 
entered Stoke.&nbsp; After picking up and doing a head count, Ronnie pointed the bus 
in one direction, then another, then another, until even Yup got confused.&nbsp; 
Cheadle and Ashbourne were close contenders amongst the mystery guesses but all 
money was off as the bus dropped into Froghall, struggled up the other side and 
continued beyond onto Whiston and the first pub, The Sneyd’s Arms.&nbsp; The first 
clue, no bigger than 6 inches in height, adorned a wall in the bar area showing 
a well kitted-out Robin Hood figure.&nbsp; Could this have been the previous name of 
the pub as rumour has it?</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">The landlord was all 
of a flutter, despite the assistance of a delectable assistant.&nbsp; Or maybe that’s 
why he was in a tiswas, and struggling to keep his hands still.&nbsp; He had at least 
remembered to provide a barrel of Bishops Farewell for us, prompting Mr 
Tahoohigh, Yup’s bestest ever mate, to request his hand in marriage.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">Lancaster’s Red Nose 
Reindeer was in the stable but with only 40 minutes allowed there was only 
enough time to finish off the barrel of Bishops and ensure we could keep to the 
programme of fitting 3 pubs in before the indian.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">Back on the bus we 
continued off into the wilds and on to the Yew Tree at Caldon Lowe.&nbsp; A unique 
Aladdin’s cave awaited our arrival, full of amazing antiques and oddments, 
hidden deep amongst the limestone quarries.&nbsp; Amazing that Fagan kept his hands 
in his pockets throughout the stay!&nbsp; Those patches are beginning to kick in.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">Al, (or Alan) the 
infamous owner, had cut up the pre-ordered pork pies and these were dished out 
along with jars of mustard as we arrived.&nbsp; Burton Bridge bitter, mild and lager 
were the only drinks available, but at prices dating back almost as far as some 
of the furniture, who cared?&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">The pickled eggs, 
pie and Joules sign clues could be spotted if you could find them amongst the 
clutter.&nbsp; The oches were taken up at the dart board and the skittles table, and 
several gathered around the pianola.&nbsp; Alan obliged when requested to insert a 
roll of music into it and we stayed another hour whilst The Silver Bear and Col 
Surry pedalled like fury.&nbsp; It’s been a while since Beardee’s twinkle toes have 
been spotted moving so swiftly, but move they did as the temptation to keep the 
tempo going proved inspirational and he began dreaming of a white turkey.&nbsp; <b>

<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">The sing-along 
accompanying the ivory bashing, was going so well that the third pub was knocked 
on the head.&nbsp; The Jervis Arms at Onecote was to have provided us with an 
extensive array of fine ales; but perhaps we’ll visit it next year, who knows?</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">Sadly, it was time 
to move on.&nbsp; Back on the bus the nearest guesses were read out by the Yupmeister.&nbsp; 
There was a tie for 1<sup>st</sup> place with both Beardee and Jacko guessing 
the market town of ‘Leek’, and forcing Ronnie into drawing out a chillie from a 
balti dish for the second year running.&nbsp; The winner would receive £15 whilst the 
loser would of course have to devour his chillie before the bus would be allowed 
to move on.&nbsp; Congrats to Beardee on winning and well done Jacko for taking it 
all in one mouthful, as always!&nbsp; At this stage Beardee sped to the front of the 
bus and Yup began to panic expecting the conducting to begin before we’d even 
got to the indian.&nbsp; Thankfully, it was to hand over a much appreciated bottle of 
single malt and a card from the Squarrites with thanks for his endeavours over 
the year.&nbsp; Many thanks chaps.&nbsp; I’ll have a nightcap or two over xmas if I get 
the chance. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">Of course no-one had 
actually guessed the name of the restaurant, the New Monsoon, or the place, 
Bottomhouse, and yet the clues had been easier than ever this year.&nbsp; Just 5 
minutes from the Yew Tree and we were being ushered into a fairly large room 
away from the other main dining area and other diners!!&nbsp; Were there any? I 
didn’t see any all night.&nbsp; Perhaps as well really.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">A selection of 
starters including samosas, kebabs and a pappodom basket were served within 
minutes which seemed to go down well and drinks orders were taken by the 
enthusiastic young waitresses.&nbsp; Ronnie joined us for the first time and soon got 
stuck in.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">Yup began by reading 
out Phone-a friend’s amazing deduction for this year’s mystery venue before 
running over most of the main events from the past 12 months.&nbsp; Thanks were given 
to those who had been supportive to the squarry club and had assisted in 
organising events along the way before a joke was recollected, originally told 
in Rutland about a young boy asking his father what a …ina was.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">The sound of 
‘Broadsword leader calling Danny Boy’ could be heard from the once great-escape 
artist Scottee, as Beardee was presented with a fairies wand for conducting 
duties.&nbsp; Unfortunately this was the closest imitation to a baton that could be 
found in Stoke, but as if by magic the old saying of ‘I shonna go again youth’ 
changed to ‘I will go to the ball ti youth’.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">Finally a toast was 
made to the Squarry Club and Dasher graciously accepted the challenge of 
delivering several more jokes as we waited for the slower delivery of main 
courses.&nbsp; The chef Sanjeev was wrenched out of the kitchen, after we’d finally 
been served, and introduced to the clan before we were returned to never never 
land by Ronnie via Leek, Baddeley Green, Endon, Stoke, Penkhull, Clayton and 
Westlands.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">Thanks for making it 
a most enjoyable night and a memorable year</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">Here’s to next year</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">Cheers</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">Yupmeister</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">(enjoy yer baltis)</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">

Tree and photos will be on the website soon.</span></p>
