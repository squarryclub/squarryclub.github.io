Sep 08</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i><u><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">
Up for it were:</span></u></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">
Yupmeister, Pedro, Picasso, Richee-Lionel, Granpop Bill, Keithee's up for it, 
Huge, DCeen, McCeen, Bolt from the blue&nbsp;&nbsp; (Downsize Dave?), Jacko, Graham Cork, 
and joining us for the first time, the elusive Jekyle – (Stephen Hurst).</span></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">A 
return visit to Stockport had dawned.&nbsp; For Keithee, Granpop Bill and Yup the 
trip started with Spitting Feathers at Wetherspoons in Stoke, where Granpop Bill 
confirmed that The Squarry club brewery was well on its way to fruition now that 
he’d purchased a home brew kit.&nbsp; This morning he had dropped his robust phone on 
the kitchen floor which he’d managed to re-assemble despite it splintering into 
a thousand pieces.&nbsp; There were one or two spare springs and screws, and the 
phone now only took incoming calls but he’d made a fair job of it.&nbsp; Somehow the 
prospect of assembling a full size brewery in his garage may prove just too 
difficult.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">With 
dreams of the squarry brewery in tatters we met up with most of the rest of the 
clan at Stoke station and took up some remaining empty seats.&nbsp; Huge and Jacko 
arrived simultaneously at Stockport station and Keithee led the way down to the 
arches and the Crown Inn, where Jeck was found hyding in one of the snugs.&nbsp; 
Graham arrived and spotted him, having worked together previously at Stockport 
several years ago.&nbsp; What a small world.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Kelham 
Island’s Golden Eagle was on tap, as was Oakham’s Asylum, Copper Dragon’s Pippin 
and 1816, Exmoor Gold etc etc.&nbsp; In all, 12½ ales were available, numbered 
1-12A.&nbsp; Kelham Island’s Conquistadore was recommended by Jacko.&nbsp; ‘Where </span>
<span lang="EN" style="font-size: 9.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: #333333">
gonorrhea </span><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">and 
syphilis came from’, he confirmed.&nbsp; Luckily it had ran out before the next order 
was made.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">
Alternative pub destinations were suggested by Graham, Jekyle and the locals.&nbsp; 
It was difficult to comprehend the slurred suggestions, was it the Old Vic or 
Old Mick, and was it boarded up?&nbsp; Well, we didn’t bother in the end.&nbsp; </span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Instead 
we ventured to the Swan with 2 necks, slipping alongside the narrow bar area and 
into a comfy back room where the roof was raised especially for Granpop Bill.&nbsp; 
Unfortunately, it was an awful Robinsons outlet with their bitter and Unicorn; 
unless you like Robinsons of course.&nbsp; The pub did however have a friendly bunch 
of locals, one of whom attempted to suggest an itinery for us. &nbsp;Strangely it was 
almost exactly the same as we were doing anyway, except for the ginnel route to 
Underbank.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Next on 
our itinery was the Porter’s Railway which immediately entered the memory bank 
for future trips.&nbsp; Across the road was a Frankie and Benny’s, above which could 
be spotted Jekyles house, hyden in the hills on the horizon.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">A fine 
range of ales including Floral Dance, Pitch Porter, Brewers Gold etc immediately 
jumped out as you entered the door.&nbsp; Stand out of the door with one of them and 
you were immediately liable to a £500 fine.&nbsp; ‘Be warned’, said Graham.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">A pool 
table was immediately bagged by Pedro, Keithee and Picasso. Weirdly, everyone 
was a winner with Pedro taking second place.&nbsp; Bar billiards rules are very 
strange, but then so is Pedro.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">At 
last, Richee appeared, having been assisted from the station down to the Railway 
Porter with the aid of the Yup Yup,</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">It was 
just a 5 minute stroll through town to the Indian, Sanjoys, passing a few 
ginnels and cash machines.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Dceen 
quickly retreated from a cash machine in fear of being caught on camera and 
appearing on this year’s calendar. But McCeen his Dads wallet wasn’t quick 
enough.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">We 
don’t have starters generally but Jekyle started a theme which soon spread, much 
to the delight of Pedro.&nbsp; As we devoured the starters, Bolt described the 
processes involved in dating and how much time is wasted listening to bull**** 
before making any useful progress.&nbsp; As we listened intently, Jacko and Yup 
missed the main courses arriving.&nbsp; It was obvious though that they’d forgotten 
these 2 meals which tasted as though they had been quickly thrown together to 
make up for lost time. &nbsp;They weren’t worth waiting for unfortunately, and left a 
sour taste in the mouth.&nbsp; The collection for the bill ended up short yet again, 
causing confusion, ensued by a further period of confusion with Huge and Keithee 
hanging around at the Indian waiting for Jacko, who had already joined the rest 
at the station.&nbsp; As if we’d leave anyone behind!!</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">
Luckily, Graham had only had ten pints and was sober enough to rescue them.</span></p>
