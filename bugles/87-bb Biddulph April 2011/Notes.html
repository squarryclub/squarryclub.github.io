		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt">The evening began at the Glebe in Stoke 
		close to the bus stop in Glebe Street where we 
		were to catch the bus to Biddulph, or should we have caught it in Church 
		Street?&nbsp; Oops, just a slight error there in the old 
		memory banks which won’t get mentioned in the notes....</span></font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Comic Sans MS">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt">The journey took a rather convoluting 
		route via Hanley bus station (£1.90 to Hanley then £1.60 to Biddulph)&nbsp;and 
		took what seemed like a lifetime. On the plus side, there was a young lady on 
		board offering sweets but we refused of course. You should never 
		accept free gifts we were always taught.&nbsp; An older and much wiser lady 
		said that if we should get offered tazer guns, then we should accept 
		one.&nbsp; 'You may need one if you're calling in the Crown &amp; 
		Cushion'.&nbsp; As we later found out she was right.
		</span></font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Comic Sans MS">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt">Having never been to Biddulph before 
		(and now we all know why) we started at The Bradley Green, a Wetherspoons 
		house and found a big table at the far end.&nbsp; Despite the no of taps, 
		only Abbott ale and a stronger dark beer appeared to be suitable.</span></font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Comic Sans MS">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt">Both Keithees and Nige (No-el) had just 
		arrived and Ali G and Ian joined us a short time later.</span></font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Comic Sans MS">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt">Midweek Tone and Jacko, 2 Tasmanian devils, 
		compared memories of their previous oz trips.&nbsp; Jacko, as you'd 
		expect, could recall 
		details of the places better than Midweek Tone, who had only just 
		returned. How does 
		he do it?</span></font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Comic Sans MS">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt">After a while we decided to check out 3 
		other pubs which were in close proximity; The Royal Oak, The Swan (with Boddies), 
		and the Crown &amp; Cushion with the sort of bodies that you wouldn’t wish 
		to spend a minute with, let alone an evening.&nbsp; We quickly returned to the same table in Wethers and agreed we would probably never return to Biddulph.&nbsp; Still, 
		we’d got the Indian to look forward to........</span></font></p></td>

		heels onto a neighbouring table.&nbsp; The couple were somewhat 
		surprised to see their table contents crashing everywhere but more 
		surprised to see Corky's torso rise above them when he'd lifted himself 
		up off the floor. Surprisingly, the restaurant accepted full 
		responsibility, apologised, and reinstated the couples table.&nbsp; Fair
