<p class="MsoNormal"><b><u><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">
Attracted by the ringing of the Bow Bells of London, the following Dicks 
returned for another dooo in London: </span></u></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">
Yupmeister, Mid Week Tone, Pedro, Richee-Lionel, Granpop Bill, Keithee's up for 
it, JayCee, Huge, Dasher, Craigee 50/50, DCeen, McCeen, Ax / Wilton (Chris 
Rushton), Bolt from the blue&nbsp;&nbsp; (Downsize Dave?), Scottee Free, Jacko, Stevey 
60/40 Phone a friend and Sean G on his first ever squarry appearance.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Oddly 
enough, it was a sunny day yet again as we gathered on the platform at Stoke, 
except for Sean. &nbsp;A gap opened up as super stunt man </span>
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Tahoma; color: black">Evel Knievel
</span><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Cartlidge careered 
headfirst onto the platform to join us, with McCeen in the sidecar, narrowly 
avoiding plummeting off the edge and onto the lines below.&nbsp; Following the oooohs 
and arhhhs and rapturous applause, everyone calmed down and Yup assigned seat 
numbers to everyone to avoid further excitement on the train.&nbsp; Of course it 
broke down within seconds but at least everyone had a seat in the same carriage.
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Bolt 
had eyed up some young student as he boarded and spent the whole journey 
extracting her life history.&nbsp; She took no offence though and was impressed with 
the whole ethos of the squarry club which Bolt was happy to discuss with her.&nbsp; 
Realising that some of us may not make the return train (as if?), she 
recommended cheap hotels near the Trocadero in Piccadilly Circus, which she’d 
used on several occasions. Mmmh, was she in fact dropping a hint to Bolt?</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Sean 
who had taken a train from Stafford, arrived a few minutes ahead of us and was 
glad to see familiar faces.&nbsp; Meeting up at Euston, he was looking forward to 
seeing a different part of London as he’d only ever been underground previously; 
popping up in Soho sixty four times.&nbsp; Another head count was required. All 
present and correct, and it was down to the underground ticket office for Oyster 
cards and day tickets.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">A quick 
5 minute walk from the London Bridge tube station, through the tantalising 
smells of the Borough market and we were at the Market Porter.&nbsp; Another head 
count!</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The 
Wild Hare from Bath was tasty, and Kelham Island’s Pale rider wasn’t too bad 
either even though they were served in plastic glasses (unless you were a yuppy). 
Bill asked where the Sheep Remedy ale was from. ‘Over there er er er’, someone 
declarrrrrrrrred.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The 
Posh Bangers stall had temporarily closed down so it was a ‘free for all’ around 
the market. Jaycee eyed up the Melton Mowbray pies but his cholesterol levels 
played on his conscience.&nbsp; Instead he looked out for free bread rolls which he 
could fill with the cheese samples being given away across the road, but 
couldn’t find any.&nbsp; Boston hot dogs and pasties proved to be a vital filler for 
the starving amongst us until the evening curry.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Some 
drunken git stood hollering at the junction, but no-one could understand him. 
(No, it wasn’t one of us).&nbsp; I think he was giving away bread rolls.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">We had 
a quick gander at the downstairs cells in the Southwark Tavern as recommended by 
Sparklett, sadly missing out on the Old Hooky, and skipped across the road to 
the George Inn.&nbsp; The George is a national trust gem, sitting in a cool 
courtyard, off the main road. I recall the ale being even cooler, coercing many 
to take several trips to the outside bog.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Richee 
and crew took the easy option by train to the Lamb Tavern, missing out on both 
ships, whilst the rest took a short sightseeing trip starting at Drake’s Golden 
Hind, where, nestled beside it, stood the Old Thameside Inn which looked 
promising.&nbsp; The sights included The Clink, Shakespeare’s Globe, a curved office 
building where Mid-week Tone’s daughter, Helen, works, The Tate Modern, and the 
Millenium Bridge with views of St Pauls.&nbsp; Returning back along Canon Street, 
Kamikaze Cartlidge skidded into a pub to visit the loos, before moving on to The 
Ship Inn.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">
Zollette turned up with Divine Steve hot on her trail and quickly downed a 
pint.&nbsp; McCeen was spotted carrying his ale up the steep stairs to the toilets. 
‘Ya conna trust anyone youth!’.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">
Strangely enough I didn’t take any more notes so I’ll make the rest up as I 
usually do.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The 
Lamb Tavern in Leadenhall Market was next on our list, and it was heaving, as is 
the norm on a Friday night.&nbsp; After a quick one it was time to head for Chutneys 
in Brick Lane for 6pm, where a 25% discount on the food order, 2 bottles of 
house wine, and a free pint for everyone had previously been negotiated.&nbsp; Sadly 
some of the meals were served luke warm and had to be returned to the 
microwaves.&nbsp; Still, the wine was good so I was reliably informed by Keithee.&nbsp; 
Richee and co, who had disappeared again due to Scottee’s bum issues, finally 
appeared and rapidly placed their orders. ‘How could they get lost in Brick 
Lane? asked Sean. ‘It’s a straight road!’.&nbsp; ‘And why do they keep saying 
‘youth’?’</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">A 
different route back to Euston was suggested by Divine. With some trepidation we 
took his advice and with Axe clinging tightly to Yuppies arm throughout the 
underground we arrived amazingly with 10 minutes to spare.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Another 
head count and we boarded to enter the nodding dogs competition. The Crewe boys 
would be getting the train 5 minutes after us which complicated the maths at 
this time of the night.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Next 
year, a slightly different route is proposed, taking in Soho, Covent Garden and 
Fleet Street. Hold on tight!</span></p>
