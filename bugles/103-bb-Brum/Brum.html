Seven spicers (Jaycee, Yuppy, Stubbee, Craigee, Ali Gee, Dave Bolt and Granpop 
Bill) met at Stoke Station excited about the variation to the normal curry doo 
and eager to gorge on the banquet offered at Jimmy Spices.</span></i></p>

<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: #1F497D">The eighth 
spicer stood outside the station looking confused and as JC approached the 
entrance Pedro sidled up asking ‘where are we going today?’. This is despite 
sending out a number of emails and a coloured route map particularly for Pedro.

<p class="MsoNormal"><i>
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Arial; color: #1F497D">
On the journey down to Birmingham Bill was telling how he had being down before 
to suss out the route from New Street to Edgbaston Cricket Ground. Bearing in 
mind our first task was to find our way out of the recently modernised New 
Street Station and as Bill knew the way we decided to follow him.</span></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: .0001pt"><i>
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: #1F497D">The train 
pulled into the station and we all followed Bill to get off the platform, 
unfortunately he couldn’t find the way out, and this was off the platform. (Good 
job he’d been before).</span></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Arial; color: #1F497D">
We spotted an exit sign and made our way to the control barriers where Keithee, 
Sean of the County Wounties and 2 Pie R’d Dave semi-colon were waiting. </span>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: .0001pt"><i>
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: #1F497D">‘I’m 
parched’, said Ali Gee, ‘how far is it to the first pub’. Within two minutes of 
leaving the station we arrived at the Shakespeare and little smiles appeared on 
people’s faces. Before you could say ‘To be or not to be’, Bicky and Standback 
Dave appeared. Bicky asked ‘does anyone want a drink?’, as we all stood there 
with full glasses.</span></i></td>

for the most upmarket connoisseur. Keithee was very negative at first because it 
was a cut above the normal spit and sawdust pubs he frequents and he thought it 
only had one beer (The Lost Gold) which was priced at 5p more than he normally 
pays for a pint.</span></i></p>

pay. It ended up that we were £20 short. Pedro intimated that Tony had pulled a 
fast one and sold him a phone with a broken calculator. The real truth was Pedro
