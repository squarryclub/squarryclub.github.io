<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Comic Sans MS&quot;"><i>Yuppee,
Ali Gee, R G Bargee, Mid week Tone, JayCee, D Ceen, Ian ‘Little Terrier’

 </o:p>
</i></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Comic Sans MS&quot;"><i>A
journey of several thousand miles was made by Yup to collect Pedro, the mitherer,
and taxi him from the other side of the potteries to the Potter, but we won’t
dwell on that for too long; saffron.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p>
</o:p>
</i></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Comic Sans MS&quot;"><i>When
we finally arrived, jet lagged from our energy sapping 30 hour journey, Ali Gee
and R G bargee were already supping their first pints, having arrived on a turbo
charged chariot at a quid return from neck end.&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</i></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Comic Sans MS&quot;"><i>Tone,
who was not expected till 8ish, turned up earlier than expected, still hoarse
from a public meeting held the night before.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>He came in need of further lubrication for his throat, which had dried up
at the meeting.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Although he
hadn’t been involved in the public speaking, he’d had nothing to drink over
a 3 hour period.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</i></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Comic Sans MS&quot;"><i>The
group soon grew so a comfy vacant area was found and we moved to it and sat
down.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We soon realised why no-one
was sitting there when we realised we were sitting directly in front of a log
fire.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Ah well, we’d have to drink
more to keep cool.<o:p>
</o:p>
</i></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Comic Sans MS&quot;"><i>The
chat soon moved onto likely places to go to later in the year such as Bonne in
Germany, Warsaw in Poland and even the Belgium Beer fest was mentioned which
would give Beardie the chance of joining us by train.&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</i></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Comic Sans MS&quot;"><i>There
was an excellent choice of ales, six pulls were on including from left to right:
Six nations, London Pride, Wolf bitter, Dick Turpin, Abbott, and finally, the
one on the far right end, ‘Smiles’.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>As our memories were addled the following week we couldn’t
remember which ale the last one on the right was called.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>So to end the uncertainty and see if R G Bargee’s memory is as good as
ours, I went back the following Saturday under duress of course, to
cross-examine the barman and he confirmed my recollections.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</i></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Comic Sans MS&quot;"><i>Pedro
took advantage of the free samples of ale before buying.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Luckily he did before ordering a pint of the Wolfe Ale, which would have
been better being used on a bag of fish and chips.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The barman quickly turned the badge round and we were down to 5 ales.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Ian The Terrier arrived, and as Beardie wasn’t with us, he opted for a
pint of John Smiths smoothflow, despite the range of ales on offer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>His reputation sunk to an all time lowe.&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</i></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Comic Sans MS&quot;"><i>The
next squarree at Nantwich was bought up and the date rearranged to a mid week
night, almost ... well a thursday actually, the night before good friday.&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</i></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Comic Sans MS&quot;"><i>Dangerous
Dave joined us an hour late as promised, having woken up from a deep slumber,
but only to find himself sat beside the fire which was still rampant.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Don’t worry Dave, a natural nickname will rise to the surface
eventually.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Just ask Silver Bear.&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</i></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Comic Sans MS&quot;"><i>The
phones were red hot as messages from Shandy Boy Mogga, who was meeting us at
Wetherspoons, came through, wondering where we were, as we had spent longer in
the Potter than originally planned.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Must
have been the ale.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>So we set off to
Wetherspoons for a quick’un to meet him before going direct to the Indian.<o:p>
</o:p>
</i></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Comic Sans MS&quot;"><i>The
Blond girls were out in force at Wetherspoons.&nbsp; It wasn’t like this in
the old days, said Bill.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>When he
were a lad in the sixth form, he used to sort mail out at this very spot, when
it was the former post office.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</i></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Comic Sans MS&quot;"><i>Abbot
ale, Speckled Hen and Titanic mild were available.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>RG Bargee was quick to point out that the mild had been
watered down and was cold.&nbsp; Ali Gee seconded his motion.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Shandy boy Mogga, wasn’t too impressed with his lemonade
with a splash of ale.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We now almost
had our full compliment, just Scottie remaining who was meeting us at Shaffers.
(<a href="http://www.shaffers.net/">http://www.shaffers.net/</a>).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>So as time was pressing, it always does when you’re having fun, we
by-passed the lure of the somewhat uninviting pubs in Dresden and went straight
to meet him.&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</i></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Comic Sans MS&quot;"><i><img border="0" src="j01414233.wmf" width="184" height="226"></i></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Comic Sans MS&quot;"><i>Scottie
‘It’ll never last’ was unrecognisable to any of us at first.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>It was only when he did his Butler impression that we realised who he
was, sitting eating the Bombay mix from the smallest bowl you’ll ever see.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Sporting a black eye he had left his opponent in a worse state, or so he
says.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>(His divorce papers should be
through soon).<o:p>
</o:p>
</i></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Comic Sans MS&quot;"><i>A
wait for the tables to be cleared was expected, as we’d increased the numbers
by a couple from the original booking, so time enough to get a drink at the bar
and take bets on how long Scottie’s marriage would last.&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</i></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Comic Sans MS&quot;"><i>Finally
a long table at the rear end of the restaurant was cleared, much to our relief
and to those near the bar who’d noticed Scotties war wounds. <o:p>
</o:p>
</i></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Comic Sans MS&quot;"><i>This
time we managed to get the 2 pappodoms we’d ordered before Ali Gee got his
hands on them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The food was served
in Churchill's best on a spotlessly clean whiter than white table cloth.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>That was until Grand pop Bill threw his ale over it.<o:p>
</o:p>
</i></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Comic Sans MS&quot;"><i>The
general consensus was that the restaurant was impressive and the grub was
excellent.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Thai food was also
available and Bill was tempted into having the Thai beef red curry which he
claimed was another first.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The nans
were served cut in half and were a reasonable size and extremely tasty.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>No complaints from our end and there are intentions to return soon with
families.&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</i></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Comic Sans MS&quot;"><i>The
toilets were upstairs so I didn’t bother.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Spike was seen dragging himself upstairs at one point, his only excuse
(other than the rink) being that he was knackered after painting 3million sq
metres of walls and ceilings in his ponderosa.&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</i></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Comic Sans MS&quot;"><i>Several
phone calls were made until finally the taxis arrived.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The standards varied.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Pedro’s
taxi was first class but at a sky high price of £15.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Ours was £7.50 and was second class but comfortable.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Ali Gee returned to Neckend on the ‘group discounted quid return
chariot’, just catching it at 11pm before it increased by another 10p.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>R G Bargee’s birthday is on July 9<sup>th</sup>, so he’s promised Ali
Gee that he’d then raid his money box to pay the extra if we stop out later on
his birthday.&nbsp;<o:p>
