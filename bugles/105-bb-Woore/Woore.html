were eleven up for the jaunt out into the sticks, well according to the invite 
there was, hmmm what went wrong there?</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">And 
moving swiftly on....</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">A 
sixteen seater coach was booked from good old dependable Jay Jay's with Anthony 
at the helm.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">First 
stop was to pick up Chris, Tim, Frank and Tate from Chris's place in Werrington. 
Next stop was Penkhull, where Dave G, IT Dave and me had arranged to meet in the 
Marquis for a swift one, when I arrived (slightly late)&nbsp;the two Dave's were in 
ok but sitting in different rooms of the Pub, even the best laid plans go wrong, 
a sign of things to come maybe?</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">On the 
short trip down to Westbury Tavern, cash was collected for the evenings 
transport, based on eleven, hmmm not quite correct!</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">At the 
Westbury Tavern we found Steve W, Tone, Jaycee, Grandpop Bill and Yupmeister 
eager to jump aboard, well give or take ten minutes for Jaycee and Yupmeister to 
sedately finish their beer!</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">After a 
number of additional sips and finally handing Jaycee's beer glass to someone 
else, we all jumped aboard. It was at that point that one&nbsp;noted from a head 
count that there were actually twelve! it appears something went&nbsp;wrong with the 
table, calculator excel thing-ma-gig,&nbsp;I blame Yuppy, I copied it off his 
previous outing, where's Richie when you&nbsp;need him!&nbsp; </span></p></td>

first stop of the evening&nbsp;at&nbsp;Wrinehill was the Crown Inn where we were dropped 
off in a quiet car park, this was probably because the Pub was shut! Not one to 
miss an opportunity, while everyone was aligning themselves in an orderly queue, 
one was able to collect the remaining dues&nbsp;for the transportation from the 
Westbury Tavern Squarrites and dare I say it, hand back some cash to the 
Squarrites from Werrington! Yuppy you really need to make these excel 
thing-ma-gig's fool proof! Oh Youth send him home!</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">No 
sooner had we settled the finances for the&nbsp;transport&nbsp;but who should appear?&nbsp;none 
other than&nbsp;the landlord, Mr Ben&nbsp;(thank goodness) perfect timing! (as luck rather 
than judgment would have it).</span></td>

the doors had been opened and following a slight melee at the bar the landlord 
was soon serving the first of the Squarrites.... Steve W, how does he do that?</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">With 
six real ales on offer and a list of real ale awards as long as Grandpop Bill's 
arm everybody soon found a pleasant tipple and&nbsp;a cosy nook by the fire side.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The 
Crown is a traditional and very delightful pub and is not only noted for its 
fine ales, but also for the excellent menu on offer. It did not go unnoticed 
that even before we had finished the first pint the tables and seating within 
the Pub were&nbsp;soon taken&nbsp;by keen dinners. It wasn't long before people were 
queuing at the bar waiting for somewhere to sit and one or two cold stares 
started to fall our way, but we weren't going to be rushed!</span></p></td>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">After a 
very pleasant hour or so and&nbsp;a number of delightful pints at the Crown, half the 
group decided to head off to the Hand and Trumpet, needles to say our tables 
were taken before we had got out of the door!</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Calibri">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">A short 
stroll down the main road and we were at the Hand and Trumpet which was also 
busy with dinners, but the pub was spacious compared to the&nbsp;Crown and quite 
trendy, but lacking a little on the comfy/cosy side of things.</span></p></td>

Unfortunately upon our arrival there was standing room only, but it was not long 
before Chris had had&nbsp;a word in the managers shell like and the reserved label 
was removed from a decent table close to the bar! sooner said than done, than 
the second half of the group 'the retired contingent' arrived!</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">I think

another very pleasant hours nattering, Jay Jay's&nbsp;coach could be seen pulling 
onto the car park,&nbsp;so we supped up and headed off to meet Anthony. All aboard 
the coach and with a head count of twelve as before, but expected this time! we 
headed off to Barn India in Woore.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Barn 
India is</span><span style="font-family: Calibri">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">a 
little bit off the beaten track, but a very pleasant restaurant situated in a 
converted barn, with a charming rustic entrance and cosy reception, the 
main&nbsp;dining area&nbsp;was light and airy&nbsp;which complimented the&nbsp;comfortable and 
relaxed atmosphere.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The 
service was very efficient and friendly, with&nbsp;the waiter taking time to explain 
the more exotic dishes on the menu. In contrast to the usual Squarrite tradition 
and with Yuppy somewhat relaxed from relinquishing the reins of organisational 
responsibility, we all indulged in a starter, how naughty!&nbsp; The various 
courses and drinks all came in&nbsp;timely order, despite there being twelve in our 
party.&nbsp; All three courses were of high quality, well cooked and very tasty,&nbsp;with 
a really good choice of main meals.</span></p></td>

as usual ended up wearing some of our meal!.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">One 
other note to mention, there was also a doggy bag service which was most 
welcome, as that starter was not only delicious but also quite filling, needless 
to say some of us (I)&nbsp;could not finish our main meal and it went home with us 
(me!)</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">After 
complementing the staff on their service and wonderful culinary skills we gave 
Barn India a cheery wave and climbed aboard our coach nursing our doggy bags for 
the return drop offs to Westbury Park, Penkhull and Werrington.</span></p>
