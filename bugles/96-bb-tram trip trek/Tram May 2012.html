<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">Most of us assembled in the entrance to Stoke Railway Station in eager 
anticipation of the day’s event. The sun was shining and the shades were out. 
Ali G, MWTone and A Fine Mess opted to catch up with us later, with demanding 
office work taking preference. Dasher-no-mates was waiting on platform 2  
wondering where we were. 
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">A copy of last year’s dvd of the Germany trip was 
passed to Sid but he had no deep pockets !!&nbsp; So, to avoid carrying it around all 
day he hid it on top of a cupboard ; all under the watchful gaze of the cctv cameras. Hopefully it’d still be 
there when he returned to collect it later that night. </td>

10.55am. A few texts were exchanged on the latest 'smart' phones, to synchronise 
meeting times. Pedro, not to be 
outdone, got out his phone to everyone's amusement, but it still works !!</p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">We were soon stretching our legs along to the concourse in Piccadilly to meet 
more of the gang. The Keithee’s and TMMCorky were admiring the surroundings, 
unaware of the presence of Hard Dave, who was joining the group for the first 
time.&nbsp; He was also keeping an eye on the surroundings. </p>

Werburgh’s Road were purchased at £2.80 from the machines. Sid was most helpful 
during the selections, selecting Stretford, much to the dismay of Pedro, who was 
then left with an invalid ticket. Well, it was next to St. Werburgh on the list. The 
fear of being fined for having the wrong ticket was clearly etched on his face 
till we got to the first pub. </td>

whose head was smothered in factor 50. A forensics team would have had a field

<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">The first pub stop of the day, the ‘Oddest’ on Alhambra Road, was only a 2 
minute stroll from the station. The outside seats in the sun were taken so we 
sank into soft armchairs inside with a decent pint of Greenmill Gold and perused 
the expensive ‘a chip in the basket’ meal menu. Seats became available outside 
so at least we had an excuse to stay for another pint.</p>

<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">Texts confirmed that the 
workers were on their way from Stoke. Hard Dave confessed to having recently 
bought a new phone but hadn’t been able to find the ‘on’ button for the first 
couple of days. ‘Should have had one of these’, suggested Pedro. </p>

Dasher and Pedro now’, he proudly exclaimed !!!!! </p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">Slightly apprehensive about 
the amount we’d be drinking, Hard Dave was advised by Yup that the amounts 
varied throughout the group, but most would have half a dozen or so; Corky would 
have twice the amount as anyone else; Dasher would water his down with lemonade; 
and Jaycee would have around two. </p>

wouldn’t be open till around 5pm so we headed straight for the Horse and Jockey, 
(home of the Bootleg brewery), where we baked in the sun overlooking Chorlton 
Green. The food wasn’t cheap here either but the hunger pangs took over for most 
of us. Fat chips or thin weedy chips were available. Sid hastily bunged his big 
fat chips in his soup so he wouldn’t have to share them, whilst Yuppy just ate 
his quickly.</td>

<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">The train journey back was uneventful for most of us, except for Dasher and 
Jaycee. They ousted a couple of young wenches out of their reserved seats, 
despite the fact the carriage was empty. It had been a full day and a short time 
later Dasher’s yawns prompted one of them to ask him if it was time for bed. 
He’d have pulled if Jaycee hadn’t have been with him; or so he says !! </p>

this photo fit picture of someone 
in their early fifties who they'd like to question, last seen clambering over a cupboard at Stoke Station. 
Do you 
recognise this man? Police have added that he may not be carrying as much hair 
these days as depicted in the photo.&nbsp; He may also be using a slight German 
accent acquired from a recent break.</td>
