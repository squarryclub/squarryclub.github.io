<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The 
Macc lads up for a Happy Meal at The Raj in Macclesfield were:</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Yup, 
Jacko, Keithee, Tone, Bill, JayCee, DCeen, McCeen, Malc, Pedro, Nige, Beardee, 
Triglett, <s>Mo</s>, Richee, Bolt, Dasher, Craigee, Phone a friend, Scottee</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Dead on 
the dot of 4pm the offices emptied and 11 Stokees spilled out onto the streets 
and across to the station to meet up with the rest of the clan.&nbsp; Dasher had come 
up trumps in pre-purchasing several train tickets to save time but had failed to 
get a group discount.&nbsp; Extra tuition will be needed from the previous self 
nominated transport manager Keithee for the next venture.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Pedro 
came sporting his curry uniform of biriani blouse with kurma khakis and a madras 
tie.&nbsp; A splash or two of vindaloo would definitely go unnoticed.&nbsp; JayCee was 
glad he was wearing a more subdued outfit as he spotted a news stand with the 
headlines ‘Perv Hunt’ and consequently kept a low profile as he slipped through 
the gate.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Also 
joining us at Stoke were DCeen, Triglett, Phone-a friend and Richee; and even 
McCeen had managed to bribe his boss and leave his office early to join us. &nbsp;The 
Great Scottie joined the escape committee to the sounds of the Great Escape 
ringing out in the tunnel under the station.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">There 
was a 10 minute delay as Nige (noel) had predicted.&nbsp; Just time for DCeen to 
swallow another of his 20 indigestion tablets he now takes to avoid a headache.&nbsp; 
Jaycee continued to keep a low profile and hid in the shadows.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The 
trip was as smooth as silk and took less than 20 minutes.&nbsp; Another 2 minutes and 
we were stood outside the first pub of the night, the Waters Green Tavern; which 
was shut.&nbsp; No problem, the second was only just up the mountain.&nbsp; Alas, the 
Castle Inn was also shut.&nbsp; The research had been really successful.&nbsp; There was 
no alternative but to continue trudging up the hill, and along the main 
pedestrian zone of Mill Street to find the next on the list, the Prince of 
Wales.&nbsp; The pressure was off, the lights were on.&nbsp; What a welcome sight.&nbsp; </span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">And 
what a welcome sight too were the fine array of ales.&nbsp; Fury, Dragon Fire and 
Deuchers IPA were available in addition to the usual smoothees.&nbsp; Dasher had a 
pint of real ale with a dash, much to the disgust of the barmaid, but he had a 
reputation to keep up.&nbsp; Pedro, already served, and with jug in hand was asked 
‘what’s that’, to which he gleefully replied ‘it’s mine’.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The 
atmosphere was excellent with every seat in every nook taken.&nbsp; That was until 
Yup and Bill made their way into a corner and several hard men gave up their 
seats and scurried off in fear.&nbsp; Well done Bill.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Mo rang 
with some lame excuse that he’d got a flat tyre; a likely story.&nbsp; The phone rang 
again and Jacko was relieved to make contact&nbsp; but dismayed to hear we were 
settled on the opposite side of town to where he’d been dropped off by his 
beloved.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Signs 
around the pub displayed the fact that the pub was going to be knocked down to 
make way for development.&nbsp; A website ‘www.savetheporters.blogspot.com’ had been 
created giving the latest news.&nbsp; You’ll be pleased to hear that they heard on 22<sup>nd</sup> 
November that the pub is being saved.&nbsp; YEAH YEAH AND THRICE YEAH.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">6 
o’clock and we moved back down to the Waters Green Tavern which we hoped would 
be open; and thankfully this time it was.&nbsp; Not as full as the previous pub but a 
fine selection of ales including JHB was available.&nbsp; A photo was taken as proof 
for Mr Tahoohigh.&nbsp; The knowledgeable barman was astounding, pouring the ale 
before we even asked for it.&nbsp; Hundreds of beer mats adorned the bar and JayCee 
smiled and pointed to a bit of black which he’d always fancied.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">In the 
gents we groped around in the dark until McCeen slipped out his little flasher, 
and lit up the urinal wall.&nbsp; What a relief that was.&nbsp; Eventually someone put a 
penny in the meter and the lights came on.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Nige 
arrived but no-one noticed him for a while till he jumped onto a stool to check 
out the ‘banned’ list adorning the wall.&nbsp; We weren’t on it just yet.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The Raj 
was only a 5 minute stroll away and despite my reservations after having had 
several odd phone calls with them, they had got our reservation and had prepared 
a long table for us.&nbsp; Malc fancied a shagarama, but an 8 hour wait seemed out of 
the question.&nbsp; We all fancied a curry anyway.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The 
food and service was good, but the wine tasting was even better.&nbsp; ‘Do you want 
to suck it?’ Keithee exclaimed, after he poured the wine over the tablecloth, 
missing the glasses by at least a couple of inches.&nbsp; Those bifocals definitely 
need a service.&nbsp; At his second attempt he was chuffed to see he never drobbled a 
spot. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">A 
gigantic air conditioning unit situated in the top corner of a wall was pointed 
out, just as Pedro knocked Yup’s wine glass over to extend Keithee’s abstract 
artwork on the tablecloth.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Beardee 
was heard to say his meal was ‘really, really tasty’ and ‘it’s very nice I must 
admit’.&nbsp; The famous old ‘I shonna come again youth’ proclamation from several 
moons ago was hopefully now just a distant memory. &nbsp;Never say never again 
prompted Craigee to suggest ‘Never say never again – 007, Munich the return’.&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">It’s 
got a definite ring to it and it seemed a definite possibility but maybe we 
should live and let die as the world is not enough.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">
Goldeneye Keithee, the ‘bill sorter outer’, admirably checked over the bill as 
usual, which worked out to around £18 a head, including the spilt wine.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The 
Lands End to John O’Groats walk was mentioned again by Pedro. &nbsp;How long, I 
wonder before the anticipated ‘How are we going to get there?’ question rings 
out.&nbsp; Life doesn’t get any better Keithee spouted ‘If you can laugh you can do 
it!!’&nbsp; No-one knew what he was rambling on about, but it sounded about right.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">
Wetherspoons, across the way from the Indian beckoned for a quick one on the way 
back to the station.&nbsp; 2 minutes later we were on the platform and jumping on to 
the train for the return.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">I’m 
Loving it</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">
Yupmeister</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">(enjoy
