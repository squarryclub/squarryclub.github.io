<td width="57%" colspan="2"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">We met around 5-5.30 at the recently renamed Holy Inadequate - previously called the Rendezvous and later the New Rendezvous, which sat impressively at the corner of Etruscan Street, Etruria, surrounded by hundreds of roadwork barriers.&nbsp; The interior was also impressive as was the array of beers, including Joules IPA, a Burton Bridge ale and some others from the dark side.</font></td>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">Booked for 7.30 we were offered the choice of a side room where we could make some noise, or we could stay in the main room with the rest of the customers.&nbsp; We decided on the quiet side room.&nbsp; Scottee Free, the 13th man, arrived as the main orders were being taken and the room was quiet no more.</font></td>

Keithee's order ended in 'and a bottle of French wine' each time he spoke. </font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">Scottee-free began using semaphore to signal to a couple of girls dangling out of a window on the opposite side of the street. 'Be careful what you are signing youth', someone pointed out, 'you don't know where they've been'.&nbsp; He withdrew his arms but Richee appeared to take over signalling behind his back.</font></td>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">Michael conceded he'd become Junior Grumpy with the immense honour being passed down proudly by his dad.&nbsp; Oh yes, that was the note.</font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">Scottee-free asked to see his 'friend' Gus who was working in the kitchen, with the intention of getting a free round of drinks.&nbsp; It didn't materialise of course for anyone except Scottee-free.</font></td>

<td width="97%" colspan="3"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">Armed with discount vouchers from the 'thisisstaffordshire website we disagreed with the waiter when the final bill was presented, but we finally resolved the issue.&nbsp; No thanks of course to Pedro who hadn't got his voucher.&nbsp; He hadn't printed one off cus he's too mean to buy a printer; and Corky who had left his back at home.</font><p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">All in all a cracking evening, generally pretty good ale, a bridge too far, and a tasty curry to finish off with.&nbsp; What more could you want?</font></p>
