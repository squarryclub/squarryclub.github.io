<p class="MsoNormal">Craigy�s challenge had finally arrived.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Would his efforts all go to plan?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
pressure was on, luckily the heavy snows had begun to melt away just in time, so
the trek to another neck-end type of place could go unhindered.&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">After much deliberation, both a mini bus and a taxi had
been ordered to keep costs down, but for one way only from the Westbury.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Weren�t we coming back?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Are
the rumours of it not being in the safest of areas true? <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Phil
joined us in the minibus for extra security carrying a weighty carrier bag
loaded with out dated wine, some going back as far as 1999.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Neck-ender Nige (no-el), Spikelet (Golden Wonder Boy), new
recruit Dave (Russ), and Keith (I�m on for it), were waiting patiently for us
in the salubrious lounge at the King's Head or Scrimmeys.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Nige give his seat up to Bill so that they could converse on a common
level.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I could sense the �I�m a
celebrity, get me out of here� vibes from Phil as we entered.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Not the normal totty-spotting type of pub that Beardie�s used to, he
took up a position in the look-out tower at the end of the bar for a while with
what surely must have been a pint of smoothflow.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>We started on the doubles early tonight spotting Andy Norman in the other
bar.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It obviously wasn�t though
cus he was drinking a pint.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Bass was really the only option on tap.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Scrimmeys has a good reputation for its Bass. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>As
good as it ever can be, the choice of real ales was otherwise lacking.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Richie and Scottie confessed to arranging a �Big Apple� trip in March
using half of Scotties wedding money.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
wedding isn�t due until October, but unless Scottie works overtime then it
looks like the promised trip to Cyprus may get changed to Blackpool or Neckend.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>What a start to married life!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And
a stag night to pay out for yet, to which everyone�s invited.&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">As the Indian was not licensed we tripped down to a local
offie. The main offie had closed at 8pm so as luck had it we found another one
just down the road. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>We�d have had
no choice but to share Beardie�s wine if this offie had been shut.&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">It was a night for seeing doubles.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Another one appeared in Shezans in the form of Dickie Bird,
out having a quiet night out with his wife and friends..</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">A table had been laid out for 12 diners.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>How strange when there were 14 of us?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>An extra table was added on the end by the waiter and it�s previous
owners ejected elsewhere.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>A space on the end now became available which Nige used as a
stop gap throughout the evening when he couldn�t squeeze back into his chosen
seat.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>No sooner were we
settling down however when we were up again to begin the sampling.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>The same dishcloth that is used in Harry�s Bar in Stoke
must have been used to clean the tables.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It
was nigh impossible to rearrange a plate or cutlery without using a jackhammer
first to pry them off the table. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Phil
opened the wine and then the beers, spraying the tables to make them just a
little bit more tacky.&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Shezans it could be argued is an improvement on the Old
Indiana Jones.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Now providing a
buffet type service only, the extensive spread of meals are arranged in heated
space helmets, like you�d see in a space movie.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Virtually everything was piping hot and available, except for the onion
bahjis which run out for a short time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Stubbie�s
had missed out again tonight on one of his favourite pastimes, oh Gilly!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>From kurmas to madras�s, the selection was excellent; and you could
always finish off if you had room with rice pudding, fruit salad or a slice of
Calcutta gateaux, or several slices in Craigy�s case.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Well I suppose he deserved it handling the pressure so well and the
nagging pain from his ulcers was now subsiding.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>With confidence rising, he confirmed he was 100% positive that he
couldn�t eat any more food.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>His swollen paunch was exposed across the table, Scottie
produced his stethoscope and tapped away to diagnose that his ulcers had gone
but that he�d only got 2 months to go.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Just
one task left then, and that was to sort the bill out.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Phil jumped in at this point to help Craigy out who by this
time had gone, along with his remaining supply of Gaviscon tablets.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>So gone in fact that he�d have still been there now sorting out the
bill; even at �9.95 a head.&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The timing was perfect, 10.30pm, paid up and full to the
brim.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The beardy boys fled in
search of life in Hanley whilst the rest of us arranged our own return journeys
home.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Some of us returned in the
same minibus, without the roof lining, and the rest by car, or ever faithful
Pam.&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Well done Craigy Baby, a man in the making.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>A separate minibus and a taxi?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A
table set for 12?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The offie
shutting at 8pm.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>No return lifts
arranged.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Bass only available.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>A minibus without roof lining!</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Can he improve his skills with the trip to Draycott to be
arranged in the near future?</p>
