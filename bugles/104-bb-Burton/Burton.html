<td colspan="4"><b><font size="4">The End of the Barrel&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Burton&nbsp; 26<sup>th</sup> July 
2013</font></b><p><b><u>Up for it were:</u></b></p>
<p>Yupmeister, Anytime Tone, Pedro, Keithee's up for it, JayCee, Ali Gee, Jacko, 
2 Pie Hard Dave Semi-Colon, Tim Mothy, Sean of the County Wounties and Mark 
Royall</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A single carriage slowly approaching Stoke Station could be seen by the 
hordes waiting on platform 1, knowing that it was going to be a tight 
squeeze. Today, it appeared, just happened to be Ladies Day; one of the busiest 
days in Uttoxeter’s Racing Calendar.&nbsp; Taking no prisoners we pushed through the crowd 
and fought our way to grab a seat; anywhere would do.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Once settled, and in between hot flushes, generally experienced by women, 
Jaycee explained that he was considering various broadband and tv package 
deals.&nbsp; 2 Pie R’d Dave Semi-Colan said as long as he could get ‘Catch Phrase’ he 
was perfectly happy.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The jovial conductor was most helpful, bellowing out instructions as loud as he 
could; telling everyone to stay where they were until he’d opened the doors at 
both ends of the carriage at each stop.&nbsp; Only then could they disembark !!&nbsp; The 
carriage emptied at Uttoxeter and The Royal Mark from Talke, complete with a man 
bag containing his hat, moved seats to join 
us for his first squarry do.&nbsp; Now the 
carriage was quieter, there was an opportunity for the conductor to confirm the 
times of our connection in Derby.&nbsp; Shame he wasn’t aware that it would be 
delayed 20 minutes, depriving us of valuable drinking time.&nbsp; Walking from 
platform 2a to 2b did at least pass ten seconds.</p>

<p>It was only ten minutes or so to Burton, where, after a short stroll past the 
town hall, which both Tony and Jaycee recollected having visited previously, we 
located the Old Cottage Tavern.&nbsp; Except for 2 guys the pub was empty and there 
was no sign of the advertised beer festival.&nbsp; ‘Where's the beer festival??’ asked Yuppy.&nbsp; ‘Not here darling’, came the reply from the barmaid.&nbsp; Weird.&nbsp; It was 
definitely advertised on their web site.

<p>A limited selection of Old Cottage Beer Company ales was available, which 
included their Halycon Daze, Stout and Oak.&nbsp; ‘This aint right’, announced Pedro, 
and returned his Stout to the barmaid.&nbsp; ‘I’m not used to waiting this long for a pint’, said Pedro, as the barrel was 
being changed.&nbsp; ‘That’s because you’ve never stood at a bar before’, 
shouted Yuppy.&nbsp; 
‘That’s not quite true’, added Keithee, ‘although it was some time ago when 
there were only 3 groats to the shilling’.</p>

The 2 guys, who were now seated amongst us, turned out to be experts from the 
brewery and said in the trade they would call it ‘the end of the barrel’.&nbsp;
<p>But after necking most of their pints, which they had previously said was in 
fine fettle, agreed it was sh*te and requested a replacement too.</td>

<p>With no food available we opted to move on to The Roebuck.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jacko caught up 
with us, having ran 4 miles from his son’s house where he’d quickly parked up 
after being delayed on route.&nbsp; A brief look inside the lack lustre Roebuck confirmed it was 
not for us, with limited ales and atmosphere, so we briskly moved on to the 
Devonshire Arms which instantaneously hit the right spot.

<p><i>Before WWII the Burton Brewery ran a series of advertisements for Burton's 
Beer. In these adverts the characters would use the phrase to explain the 
absence of one of the characters in the advert, implying that they had gone for 
a pint of Burton's. One of the adverts (at least) was football related and 
featured teammates asking the location of a missing player (probably the 
goalkeeper/referee??) and being told he had 'gone for a Burton'.&nbsp; During 
WWII pilots used the phrase to describe the absence of pilots who had failed to
