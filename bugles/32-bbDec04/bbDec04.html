<p><b>The Mystery Christmas Squarry Night of Friday 10<sup>th</sup> December 2004
revealed:</b></p>
<i><u>
<p>30 Squarrites were up for it:</p>
</u>
<p>Ali Gee, R Gee Bargee, Brockie, Joseph Tahoohigh, Spikelet, Mid week Tone,
Keith (I’m on for it), Yupmeister, Trigglet, Phil (Wok n Woller), Dave
(Sleepy) Byrne, Bill (Lover of Prague), Stubbee (Chuckee?), DCeen (his wallet),
Mceen (his student grant), Rob B (Sparky), JayCeeWoller, Beardie, Ritch
(Lionel), Scottie (still married), Craigee (50/50), Col (George Formby kid),
Moon beam, Heavy Steve Machine, Pedro, Andy - lager boy, Malc Jay, Mo who, Ian
Seeweed and last but not least Nig elf. Sadly Jacko couldn’t make it having
returned from India the previous day with a dose of delhi belly ! ! !</p>
</i>
<p>The evening started early for some squarrites who met up in Harry’s bar
around 4 ish, since the Yupmeister had arranged for the &quot;chariot of
fire&quot; to collect them in Stoke. The boys displayed admiral control and only
supped a couple of pints of Directors before Spikelet blew the whistle and we
set off for the bus followed by three border collies and a herd of sheep.</p>
<p>On arrival at the Westbury Tavern (centre of the universe) the remaining
squarrites were well embedded and a bonus ale or two was necked. A sombre’ro
Pedro brightened up after having had a catastrophic day, losing his pussy.
Yupmeister had arranged for Adnams Broadside to be put on to cheer him up, mmmh,
while we all got together for a roll call before the adventure proper could
begin. Anxious calls on the DCeen (his wallet)’s mobile tracked down Mceen his
dads wallet in the middle of a traffic jam on the M6. Directions were given,
under the threat of death if the destination was revealed, so that Mceen his
dads wallet could meet up with us later.</p>
<p>So with 29 of us aboard the chariot headed out of Westbury Park in a
northerly direction which immediately put paid to the hopes of squarrites who
had guessed southern venues from the most weird set of clues ever, likened to
clues the Riddler used to set for Batman in the sixties series. Even Yupmeister’s
ever-willing assistant, Midweek Tone, didn’t understand them and he knew where
we were going! More worrying though for Beardee, the &quot;chuck&quot; wagon was
heading towards Ali G’s neck-end. Christmas lights adorned houses on all sides
of the road, except near neck-end of course, where they had all been stolen. The
cheers and groans began as the coach headed west then north, this way and that
way. Ronnie, our driver for the night played his part up front, steering the
psychedelic spray express through the traffic lights at Talke (the only lights
remaining in the neck end area ! ), and headed for the Cheshire border, much to
the relief of Beardie.</p>
<p align="left">It was now obvious that no one really knew where we were going, and judging
from his clues neither did Yupmeister. Anyway the bus finally pulled into the
first mystery pub, the Bulls Head at Smallwood, and as promised the pre-ordered
pints were waiting for the lads to neck, along with Mceen his dads wallet. What
luck us travelling north. The ales included Coach House Flintlock and the
seasonal Everards Sleighbells. Beardie of course had the Tetley Cask with 2
dashes and the lager boys had …….. <img border="0" src="https://baltibugle.co.uk/bugles/32-bbDec04/red herring.gif" style="float: right; padding-left: 5; padding-right: 5; padding-top: 4; padding-bottom: 5" width="116" height="118"></p>
<p align="left"> The Beardee boys, along with honorary
Beardee boy for the evening, Heavy Steve Machine, made a beeline for a room with
a sign over the door that said ladies. Unfortunately it was another &quot;red
herring&quot; as it led to the bogs.</p>
</font><p><b><a href="https://baltibugle.co.uk/bugles/32-bbDec04/Hanger.jpg"><span style="z-index: -1"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4"><img border="0" src="https://baltibugle.co.uk/bugles/32-bbDec04/Hanger.jpg" width="123" height="63" style="float: left; padding: 5"></font></span></a></b><font FACE="Comic Sans MS" SIZE="2">So, the first clue of the hanger revealed, pints quaffed, and the lads
warming up, it was back to the barf wagon and onward further into Cheshire. Joe
claimed that he had never been so far away from home, even on his holidays.
Onwards through Holmes Chapel and northwest down cobbled lanes to our next
destination, The Bells of Peover, where, Beardie would finally pull a cracker.<b><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4"><span style="z-index: -1"><a href="https://baltibugle.co.uk/bugles/32-bbDec04/hat and coat and brolly.jpg"><img border="0" src="https://baltibugle.co.uk/bugles/32-bbDec04/hat and coat and brolly.jpg" width="194" height="253" style="float: right; padding-left: 6; padding-right: 6; padding-top: 5; padding-bottom: 6"></a></span></font></b></font></p>
<font FACE="Comic Sans MS" SIZE="2">
<p>What a pub, what a location, what a setting, and what a</font><font FACE="Comic Sans MS" SIZE="2"> culture shock for the
Cheshire set! It was like deliverance <a href="https://baltibugle.co.uk/bugles/32-bbDec04/treemendous.jpg"><img border="2" src="https://baltibugle.co.uk/bugles/32-bbDec04/treemendous_small.jpg" style="float: left; padding: 5" alt="treemendous.jpg (194891 bytes)" width="158" height="120"></a> with the plot reversed. The locals didn’t
know what had hit them and surrounded the bar for safety. As the pints and
whiskeys were ordered the squarrites ran amok as they investigated the pub. The
staff ran around and herded the boys into a side room as they designated certain
parts of the pub ‘off limit’. Some of the lads had been tolled to check out
the church bells </font><font FACE="Comic Sans MS" SIZE="2"> outside (sorry). Were they as loud though&nbsp;
as the bells that
would be ringing in their heads the next day, or even the day after that for
those who didn’t make Saturday. The Bombardier, Theakstons and Directors were
brewed to perfection. John Smiths and lager was available for those who had no
taste buds. After another pint or three, and Yuppers keen to stick to his
programme called time; much to the relief of the staff who were probably just as
keen to see the lads go, especially after Beardees cracker pulling (apparently
they were very expensive too). Yes, Beardee did pull a cracker but Ali G was at
the other end of it!</p>
<p>So back on the wheels of fire it was time for Yup to announce the winner of
the competition. In reverse order, DCeen (his wallet) was 4<sup>th</sup> with
Buxton. Mo ‘who’ was 3<sup>rd</sup> with Manchester. 2<sup>nd</sup> place
went to Beardie with Macclesfield. And in top position was Spikelett with
Middlewhich, 9 miles out, but the nearest nevertheless. Spikelet obviously used
his lateral thinking skills to the best advantage, or he did what he usually
does……….the opposite to everybody else; anyway, no one was bitter in the
slightest.</p>
<p>To his own relief, Midweek Tone quickly explained a further mystery of an
anonymous email ruse, which had been sent to Yup 2 days previous by a mystery
squarrite aimed at confusing the Yupmeister. Despite untold explanations, the
confusion still continues, and not just for Yuppy. The true explanation is
perhaps best being told on a future squarry night, after a pint or two. Did
Beardie truly guess Macclesfield, or did he correctly guess the actual
locations??</p>
<p>The destination had still not been revealed as Ronnie trundled us out from
The Bells down the cobbled lane and headed this time in a northeasterly
direction. Having exhausted his orienteering skills Dceen waited until we were
in the High Street of Knutsford before finally guessing the correct destination
at the fiftieth attempt.</p>
<p>The luxury, unsoiled, bus dropped us off in the High Street and the boys
filed in to the curry house, Shamoli, and into the bog featured in the Yupmeister’s
clues; a bit of a tight squeeze with a strange feeling of déjà vu. It must
have been all those hours of staring at the clue.<img border="0" src="https://baltibugle.co.uk/bugles/32-bbDec04/Narrow bog.jpg" width="251" height="335" style="float: right; padding-left: 10; padding-top: 7"></p>
<p>The Indian was only one of two in Knutsford. Having tried and tested both of
them during his many reckies, Yup had chosen this one for the quality of the
food and service, but not for the décor or size of bog. A special mention and
thanks have to go to Mo ‘who’ for supplying us all with the very nicest,
finest, bottles of red wines that graced each table and in plentiful supply! So
well done Mo ‘who’ and thanks from us all. Triglett needed more wine of
course, and duly ordered the dearest cabernet shiraz for keithy ‘who was on
for it’. Delays were inevitable, and always will be, when a group of 30
descend on a restaurant. 99% of the squarrites accepted this except Dceen ‘his
starter’ who, totally out of character, was wound up into a frenzy by his son
(as if he needs it), and was heard to lay into the waiters on several occasions.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="https://baltibugle.co.uk/bugles/32-bbDec04/statue.jpg" width="222" height="291" style="float: left; padding-right: 5">Once fed the lads headed out into the town for the last pint, luckily there
was a real ale pub handily placed across the road, with two handily placed
planters outside. Overall the food had been good except for two of the curries
containing &quot;the Alien&quot;. Sure enough, as per the script, they didn’t
intend hanging around for long inside Stubbie’s (ably supported by Yup) and
Keithie’s stomachs, and went for the early spray. One of the planters was
particularly handy for Joe to wrestle up chucker Dave Stubbs into, with
proposals of marriage, and the other came within easy reach of Keithee (I’m
upchuck in for it) to unload the other Alien into. Knutsfords hopes of winning
or taking the title of best town in bloom competition took a nosedive, when
Chuckie nose-dived into the plant pot for the second time.</p>
<p>Squarrites in the past have made reference to Phil’s (Wock n Woller) matrix
style jacket, but as usual the truth will out. It is nearer to Oliver than
Matrix since it contained a few items of &quot;loot&quot;, such as popadom
dishes and ale glasses; all he was short of was a dog called &quot;Bullseye&quot;.</p>
<p>And with that it was on to bus and the run back home, with an additional lap
around Knutsford to collect those who couldn’t manage to get on the bus the
first time. Col (George Formby kid) plucked away in magnificent form on his
ukulele at the back of the bus and the singing began. Beardee took on his
familiar role of bus conductor (Scottie, who’s still married’ probably
impersonated On the buses Butler at this stage?) using a knife supplied from the
jacket of Phil Sykes and orchestrated the engineer’s songs. The best song was
of course Delilah! Ronnie began to get nervous seeing the glistening knife being
wielded by the maestro (or was he a wild rover?) reflecting in his rear view
mirror, and attempted to play a Max Bygraves tape to calm things down. Failing
miserably he looked on desperately as we headed south, with Rob ‘Sparky’ and
Yupmeister restraining Butlers movements.</p>
<p>A taxi had been pre-arranged for Nig elf and Ian Seeweed but this was
cancelled at the death and Ian’s dad picked them up instead. A limousine was
pre-ordered for Ali G and Argee Bargee which disappeared into the darkness of
neck end. The natives eyes lighting up the sky as they hurled bricks at it and
reshaped it into a rover.</p>
<p>Joseph was kicked out at Cross Heath and could be seen falling into privet
hedges. Triglett, still on autopilot from when he was previously accepted into
Westbury Park, followed Beardie and Yupmeister into the Brackens where he
pretended he was being picked up by an organ grinder.</p>
<p>Was it the best ever mystery night, n h a a a ………..wait till next year.
Craigee gave it the thumbs up though with a 100 out of 100, but may change his
mind in the near future. Perhaps we may have to return to the ‘easy-clean’
seat type wagons provided by Rosevilles next year. Perhaps we should have a
Squarrite Charter for next year? :</p>
<p>Thou shalt not nick stuff</p>
<p>Thou shall exercise politeness and restraint in restaurants and pubs</p>
<p>Thou shalt not chuck up</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>Thou shalt not wield a knife</p>
<p>Any others?</p>
<p>Thou shalt not have starters? oooooooooh</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whatever, see ya next year, perhaps.</p>
