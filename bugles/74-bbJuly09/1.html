<p><strong>On 17th July 2009, the rain in Chester fell mainly on the Plain, Georgian, Jacobean and Victorian Ale Houses </strong></p>
<p><strong>Up for it were: </strong></p>
<p>Yupmeister, Mid Week Tone, Pedro, Richee-Lionel, Granpop Bill, Keithee's up for it, Stubbee, JayCee, Dasher, Craigee 50/50, Utterly, Bolt from the blue (Downsize Dave?), Stew Art and Corky. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A final check on attendees proved Dasher had &#8216;got it wrong' and couldn't make it, whilst Utterly had opted for a flyer to Berlin . Arrangements were put back half an hour to allow Craigee to shower and apply talc behind his ears. Our reliable minibus turned up on time at the Westbury after a couple of pick ups at Stoke and Penkhull and set off up the D road towards Chester , passing the tempting Snugbury's famous Ice Cream factory. We were distracted temporarily by an eager Richee who passed around a portfolio of his Californian Dream vacation and wine trail planned for next year, including Los Angeles , Las Vegas , Grand Canyon etc etc to drum up enthusiasm. Keithee's up for it dropped off but was still up for it. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>Rain had been forecast today, which is mighty unusual for a squarry do, (I'll have to have a word !) but at least we'd be indoors for most of the day. As we arrived in Chester , text messages were received from Corky who had arrived earlier and was now on his second pint in the first pub waiting for us to arrive. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>We jumped off in the middle of Chester, with Bill, our driver appearing reluctant to drop us off any nearer to our first call; Telford's Warehouse, at Tower Wharf, Raymond Street. Still, it gave us an opportunity to slide along part of the slippery walls and grab a brief glimpse of the infamous racecourse. Concerned that Corky would be on his back by the time we arrived we stepped up the pace. It was a close call. Stew was spotted sitting on one side of the pub sipping fizzy lager, whilst Corky was seen sitting at the large open bar necking his 4 th pint. Which was worse?? </p>
<p>It would have been a perfect setting to begin our day, sitting outside by the canal in the sunshine, but sadly it was not to be with a grey sky and rain still falling. But what the heck, the inside of this Georgian, grade 2 listed pub was spacious with industrial artefacts and a large window overlooking the canal basin; oh and the Salopian's Darwins ale and Horbeam's High Summer were top drawer too. So impressed was JayCee that he opted for half and half in a pint glass which was disappointing, and Corky managed pint 5, a Cheshire Cat, bringing an even bigger grin to his face. </p>
<p>The Beardy boys; Richee, Downsized Dave and Craigee, were on the slippery slope, ordering a snack and checking the tilt on an old warped wooden table with their glasses while they waited. Could this have been the inaugural match of the glass sliding championship? </p>
<p>Upstairs was a restaurant and contemporary art gallery which we didn't get chance to look at. The room we were in is well known for its music nights since its conversion to a public house in the 1980's. Amongst those who have appeared here allegedly are John Williams, Richie Havens, Coldplay, John Martyn, Robert Plant, Roy Harper, Nick Harper, Martin Carthy, Steve Harley, Labi Siffre, John Renbourn, Tom Paxton, Fairport Convention, Steve Young, Argent and Nils Lofgren. What a memory I've got! </p>
<p>Led by Stew, we opted for a shortcut through the streets instead of following the walls, giving the Fat Cat a miss, and headed to the Brewery Tap, formerly Gamul House, in Lower Bridge Street . After his first impressive pint, Corky took down the details of the Spitting Feather Brewery for a possible future visit. </p>
<p>

<p>Gamul House, once a Jacobean great hall, was originally home to the Gamul family who allowed King Charles 1st to stay there for a few days in 1645. Little did he k now that it would become The Brewery Tap supplying Spitting Feathers Brewery ales to the Squarry Club in 2009. History had been made. </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>The Bear &amp; Billet just below the Brewery Tap was difficult to avoid, so we didn't. Richee boasted of having had already 2 Saxon Blondes and a White Temptress on the previous night and still had the energy to try a Blonde Witch in a twosome with Granpop Bill. Stew ventured away from the standard light lager, trying instead a black Budweizer, a halfway house between lager and Guinness. </p>
<p>

<p>Up and along the walls again, we soon arrived at the Albion Inn, the last remaining classic Victorian corner street pub inside the City Walls of Chester. The pub walls were adorned with all kinds of memorabilia and numerous signs reflecting England around the time of the 1914-18 war. Well hidden amongst the signs were directions to the toilets which everyone missed; and circled the kitchen quarters instead. </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>We were hoping to find oatcakes on sale but were disappointed to find only baps available. The Stubmeister cheered us up with a rendition of the striptease tune as he tantalisingly unpeeled his bap; der, der, derrr, der, der, der, derrr. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<p>As a move was being to be made to go Corky got &#8216;Bitter and Twisted' with time running out. Luckily, it was raining outside. &#8216;Shall we stay in the Albion ?' someone asked. Despite the 100mm/hour torrential storms outside, one or two were still eager to move on. Lionel Blaire, turned Gene Kelly, and hopped into the gutter in his dancing shoes, and began singing in the rain. He soon returned to the warmth of the Albion until the rain subsided and dried his Columbus Coat out. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The sun eventually came out, giving Graham chance to finish off his 6th or 7th pint, but who's counting? and we set off to our final stop, the Old Harkers Arms in Russell Street , before the indian. Stew (known affectionally as Steve to JayCee) popped in to the Gate of India to confirm the booking. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Old Harkers Arms had a similar appearance to a typical busy London pub, with a cracking atmosphere.  </p>
<p>

<p>The Gate of India entertained us with excellent service, tremendous birianis which Spike would die for, and provided fantastic value. </p>
<p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There was even time after the Indian to call into the Union Vaults, a traditional backstreet corner pub, a really friendly place and one of a dying breed of decent backstreet pubs, for shorts and a game of bagatelle. </p>
<p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As usual, my notes reduced significantly as the day drew on; although it's said I make them up anyway. On this occasion however, having a great time amongst a great bunch of friends became more important. And the photos tell a much better story. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A great day, and many thanks to Stew Art and MW Tone who compiled the days events. We will return most definitely in the near future. </p>
<p>Cheers </p>
<p>Yuppers </p>
<p>(enjoy yer baltis) </p>
