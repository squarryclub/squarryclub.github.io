<P class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&nbsp;</P>
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN 
style="FONT-FAMILY: Comic Sans MS">The evening started with all squarrites 
pampering and preening themselves in their respective scattered hovels, 
following a long, but largely pleasant, day’s toil to earn sufficient funds to 
support the feasting addiction.</SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</P>
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN 
style="FONT-FAMILY: Comic Sans MS">Keithee ‘I’m up for it’ and Yupmeister 
boarded one of the select Westbury carriages only to find D C’een and M C’een 
huddled together on the back seat, allegedly to maximise the distance to cost 
ratio of their ride. &nbsp;Upon arrival at the Newcastle bus terminal separate 
groups of squarrites were seen to converge on to the Audley Explorer stand. 
&nbsp;Most had arrived, as planned, and boarded the explorer by 18:08. &nbsp;The 
explorer, about to set off, was then halted by the late arrival of Victor 
Meldrew, who had attempted to disguise himself as Mid-week Tone, only to be 
greeted by the blinding flash of cameras from the papparatsi, who were not 
easily duped. &nbsp;The journey, although slow, was comfortable but within 
minutes of setting off the call of “Craigee wants a wee” echoed around the 
cabin. &nbsp;No one seemed to know where they were, not even the much-travelled 
Pedro, who advised the group “this area was one of my hunting grounds”. 
&nbsp;Fortunately the pilot new our destination and dropped us all in the middle 
of the Bignall-end road works, adjacent to the Plough at 18:35. 
</SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</P>
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN 
style="FONT-FAMILY: Comic Sans MS">The much-heralded Plough was taken by 
complete surprise by the onslaught of desperate boozers. &nbsp;Having never had 
to serve more than two gentle folk per evening they were slow to pick up the 
required serving speed, resulting in some squarrites not being attended until 
18:50. &nbsp;It was only the timely intervention of the Silver Bear who stood at 
full height and pronounced, “Aye-up youth, I am a local” that enabled some 
stragglers to be served. &nbsp;The quality of the ales on offer, were however, 
quite delightful and the squarrites appeared to indulge in what was described as 
an attempt at self-drowning. &nbsp;Triglett arrived at 18:52 to join the 
festivities, after being dropped off by Mrs Triglett, and making sure he did not 
get called up to buying a round.&nbsp; The time came all too soon to advance to 
the next venue, the Mucky Duck.</SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</P>
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN 
style="FONT-FAMILY: Comic Sans MS">The Black Swan was a friendly pub with a good 
selection of fine ale and a better than average standard of service. &nbsp;One 
of the locals advised that there is a beer festival at Porthill Cricket Club on 
17 March 2006. &nbsp;A quick pint downed and it was time to move on to tonight’s 
beer festival at the football club, only a short stroll away.</SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</P>
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN 
style="FONT-FAMILY: Comic Sans MS">The venue, as with most beer festivals, was 
packed, but the squarrites with their own individual techniques of 
un-ceremoniously barging their way to the bar, were soon guzzling. &nbsp;The 
Silver bear threw the bar staff into disarray by ordering two pints of Ibstock 
Brick. &nbsp;It’s OK, he is a student. &nbsp;D C’een and M C’een were spotted 
violently devouring respective pork pies, without the compulsory singing of the 
“Who ate all the Pies” song. &nbsp;As punishment Ali Gee made a bid for a tray 
of pork pies and they were forced to watch the swarve and gentlemanly partaking, 
of the diced pork pie, by the other Squarry club members. &nbsp;M C’een was 
later seen coming back from the toilet and said “its bigger than I thought it 
was”. &nbsp;It’s OK he was a student recently. &nbsp;Craigee 50-50 said “you 
cannot beat Iceberg youth”; yet another converted lager boy! &nbsp;Joe managed 
to acquire and devour the last pint of Bishops Finger so it was time to 
leave.</SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</P>
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN 
style="FONT-FAMILY: Comic Sans MS">The curry-guzzling venue for the evening; the 
New Royal Balti, was booked for 21:15. &nbsp;As the New Royal Balti does not 
hold an alcohol licence, the squarrites descended on to the local off-licence, 
who, tipped off, had recruited extra serving staff to meet the onslaught. 
&nbsp;The punctual arrival of squarrites at the New Royal Balti was greeted by 
“Oh bugger, we are not ready yet” (spoken in the Audley dialect of Hindu). 
&nbsp;“Can you come back in 15 minutes?”. &nbsp;The squarrites at the head of 
the column quickly departed and headed for the nearest pub for a quick drink, 
while some squarrites, having broken formation, wandered around aimlessly, and 
one small, but dedicated group, stayed behind to guard the 
house.</SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</P>
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN 
style="FONT-FAMILY: Comic Sans MS">Seats secured, Red wine (mmm Red wine) and 
beer at the ready, the meals were ordered. &nbsp;Pedro and Picasso, even after 
strict instructions to the contrary, ordered their usual Chicken Chat, but with 
the assertions that their controversial deviation from the game plan was not to 
delay the arrival of the main meals, as the last carriage was to leave Audley at 
23:00. &nbsp;The Curry Captain averted all-out mutiny by insisting that he could 
provide private transport to Newcastle for less than a pound per head. &nbsp;The 
food soon arrived and the evening then descended into the usual drunken 
debauchery.</SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</P>
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN 
style="FONT-FAMILY: Comic Sans MS">The squarrites, now p…ed and well fed, paid 
up and made for returning home.&nbsp; Mr Tahoohigh, realising his bus was due, 
searched his pockets and left a £20 note on the table to settle up.&nbsp; If 
he’d have known he was about to miss the bus back to the Plough by 15 seconds 
and have to make a run for it, he’d have …………… </SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</P>
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN 
style="FONT-FAMILY: Comic Sans MS">Mrs P yet again arrived on time to collect 
Keithee ‘I’m up for it’ and promptly advised him that he was p…ed again. 
&nbsp;Being smart he quickly responded to the attack by stating that “I am not 
as drunk as some thinkle peep I am”. </SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</P>
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN 
style="FONT-FAMILY: Comic Sans MS">The Silver Bear, in his natural habitat, 
sloped off to his warm and inviting cave with the intention of hibernating until 
Monday morning.&nbsp; A Jethro Tull album comes to mind ‘To be thick as a 
brick’.&nbsp; It’s a mistake anyone could have made, even Mr Tahoohigh 
!!</SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</P>
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN 
style="FONT-FAMILY: Comic Sans MS">The remaining 12 slipped outside to see a 10 
seater minibus arrive.&nbsp; The driver panicked as he could see his licence 
being stripped off him by the fuzz if he were to get caught being 
overloaded.&nbsp; To keep him happy, D Ceen and M Ceen kept their heads down at 
the back and slid around the back of the van at every turn, like the 
bobsleighers seen in the recent winter Olympics.</SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</P>
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN 
style="FONT-FAMILY: Comic Sans MS">The drivers face brightened up as the load 
lightened, driving all round the Wrekin and dropping everyone off near their 
respective homes.&nbsp; Triglett was the last to dismount at the Brown Jug where 
Mrs Triglett was waiting ready to grind her organ.</SPAN></P>
