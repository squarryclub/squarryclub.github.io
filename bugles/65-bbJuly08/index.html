<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Arial">Stafford</span><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Arial"> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4/7/ 08</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Arial">Keithee 
and Pedro were out sauntering along the Gritstone way, Mid week Tone was out of 
sync after a holiday in Croatia thinking it was mid week, and several others 
sent their apologies.&nbsp; So up for it this time were: Yuppers, JayCee, DCeen, 
Granpop Bill, Craigee, Richee, Axe and Scottee.</span></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Arial">In the 
run up, DCeen had spent many an hour on the phone attempting to hire a minibus 
at a best value rate for 9, eventually opting for the public bus service 101 at 
£3.70 return.&nbsp; An 8 seater would have been enough as it happened, with Mid week 
Tone dropping out with jet lag at the last minute.&nbsp; Thank goodness DCeen’s been 
attending chilling out classes.&nbsp; The clan therefore began to gather at 
Newcastle’s bus station, Yup crept up on Granpop Bill and DCeen crept up on Yup; 
how creepy was that?&nbsp; &nbsp;The Beardee boys had planned to set out by taxi and meet 
us in Stafford at 6ish; a likely story.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Arial">The sun 
was beating down turning the bus into an incinerator.&nbsp; ‘At least the heaters 
aren’t on’, noted Bill, who had been regularly monitoring energy waste during 
his free travels with his bus pass.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Arial">JayCee 
was ready and waiting to meet us on arrival at Stafford station and guided us 
through the park and past some cheap chicks.&nbsp; The expensive birds had been 
stolen and eaten evidently.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Arial">Obviously 
the taxi driver bringing the Beardee boys into town hadn’t taken heed of Stoke’s 
warning signs which warned of the horrendous delays anticipated in the wilds of 
Parkhall due to resurfacing works.&nbsp; Surprise, surprise, they would be late !!!</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Arial">Our first 
visit was to be the Yard, a new pub within a new development, with lager, 
pedigree, and smoothflow.&nbsp; It goes without saying that we didn’t stay long.&nbsp; The 
timing coincided with the arrival of the Beardee boys.&nbsp; As JayCee led us on to 
Joxer Brady’s for a quick’un, &nbsp;Scottee revealed a pocketful of carrier bags,’ 
just for emergency use only’, he declared.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Arial">The short 
walk to the beer festival at the Gatehouse Theatre took us past the impressive 
County Wounty buildings.&nbsp; We were really impressed and swiftly moved onto the 
festival.&nbsp; This festival was Stafford’s first in 26 years and sported a host of 
ales within a 30 mile radius.&nbsp; DCeen soon fell foul of a Hairy Helmet after 
necking a witch and later regretted opting for fancy names as he does in horse 
racing.&nbsp; ‘Now, where’s the foxes hat?’ he asked, after Craigee revealed there 
were also toilets upstairs.&nbsp; ‘fox it’, said JayCee who had been running up and 
down the stairs to the toilets downstairs since arriving. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Arial">County 
Wounty Steve was introduced to us by JayCee, but the pull of more real ale and 
the pom pom of the drums filling the room as the band began setting up, along 
with the regulatory ‘one two, one two’s’ put a stop to socialising,</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Arial">The 
Salopian Golden Thread was disappointing to JayCee who was spotted taking the 
easy option and throwing it away.&nbsp; Jaipur took the accolade of being amongst the 
favourites on the night, although there were many excellent ales to choose 
from.&nbsp; ‘How big’s a gallon? asked Richee,&nbsp; ‘Is it 72 pints?’. Coming from a loss 
adjuster it’s no wonder Direct Line are going down the pan.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Arial">As time 
ran out, commemorative glasses were returned and any surplus beer tokens were 
refunded or handed into the charity box.&nbsp; One or two retained their trophies and 
ignored beer festival rules of bagging up their glass before exiting, and walked 
on with gay abandon through the streets of Stafford to the Indian.&nbsp; Perhaps this 
was why Scottee had bought his carrier bags!!</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Arial">The 
snappin at the Malabar together with the service was ‘gravy’, as Yupmeister 
junior says.&nbsp; As the meal came to an end, JayCee began to receive numerous phone 
calls from McCeen who agreed that double brandies be ordered by his dad to 
celebrate his promotion.&nbsp; ‘What’s that? Get yer dad to use his credit card if he 
hasn’t got any money left on him!!&nbsp; What’s that? Tell him to get a bottle cus 
it’ll be cheaper!! ‘. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Arial">As 
normality dawned, Richee took on the mantle of attempting to buy a bottle off 
the waiter. &nbsp;He tried but he failed; the waiter wouldn’t sell us one.&nbsp; There 
were no full bottles available. ‘How about half a bottle then’, he asked. &nbsp;‘Deal 
or no deal?’. &nbsp;Eventually his negotiating skills let him down, but fair play, 
double Martells were eventually served and paid for by Richee at a fair deal of 
£25.&nbsp; ‘Mediocre’ said Craigee.&nbsp; ‘Nice and small but perfectly rounded’ said 
Chris.&nbsp; ‘We can thank Mike when he returns.’ said JayCee.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Arial">The bill 
arrived and JayCee deputised for Keithee in sorting it out.&nbsp; Craigee said he’d 
got a telephone on him with a built in calculator to work out the bill but by 
the time he’d switched it on the bill was paid.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Arial">Scottee 
and Granpop Bill agreed to arrange a future do and Richee volunteered to arrange 
a do in Leek.&nbsp; DCeen agreed to arrange a brewery trip in Macclesfield in 
September, and JayCee agreed to check out first class train tickets for this 
year’s London trip in October.&nbsp; It was all going swimmingly well, but it was 
time to catch the bus.&nbsp; DCeen was seen falling over on the bus and Craigee began 
taking loads of photos before he pressed the stop button ‘in error’ at Tittensor.&nbsp; 
The driver wasn’t amused and failed to stop at Trent Vale when he pressed the 
buzzer again, and continued on to Newcastle.&nbsp; It was to be an early night for 
the owdies, whilst the youngsters played on into the night.</span></p>
