<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Comic Sans MS&quot;">A great day out was had by the nine squarrites who ventured into the big city on Friday
25th April.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A big thanks to the yupmeister who again brought his organisational skills to the fore and to Michael for organising the
itinerary and booking the venues.</o:p>
</span></p>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Comic Sans MS&quot;">Notably absent were Dave Gater who was apparently doing battle with some great white
stickleback up neck end pool, Spike who was suffering from jelly belly even foregoing the breakfast bacon butties, midweek Tone who doesn�t venture midweek, and Craig who�s
still</span> <span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
&quot;Comic Sans MS&quot;">weighing it up.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Comic Sans MS&quot;">&nbsp;It all began with a dash to the door at five to twelve, a dash home and a squarry
to the Station to catch the 1246. </span></p>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="mso-ignore:vglayout;position:

style="font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Comic Sans MS&quot;"><o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Comic Sans MS&quot;">Mr Branson did the business with one of his Virgins coming off the bend into the Station
at 1247. Forty minutes later and we were there on Platform 13� at Manchester Picadilly, only now we were eight. John Commins squarite was nowhere to be seen, had he fallen asleep,
was he to wake up in Aberdeen without a sporran.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We were forced to venture forth but thanks to the technology of the mobile phone we
found that in his excitement he had jumped ship early and was champing at the bit on the footway outside.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>(I was reliably informed by
an overenthusiastic Dave Stubbs, once a trained tarmacer, over and over again that it was all York stone, �you don�t see that in Stoke you know�)<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Comic Sans MS&quot;">&nbsp;We caught the free bus into the heart of the big city and were led into a huge
Wetherspoons, �The moon under the water�, at least five times larger than the one in Stafford.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This was stated on the itinerary but
this was strongly disputed by Keith Jackson who had served his apprenticeship in the weights and measures department of the ST1 club.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
first to circum to the effects of the Abbots was Keith Phillips. Upon his return from the upstairs loo he was convinced that he had looked into a large room, which indeed would
have made it five times bigger than the one in Stafford. </span>
<img src="https://squarryclub.github.io/bugles/14-bbApr03-29th/bbApr03-29th/where_9.gif" align="left" hspace="12" v:shapes="_x0000_s1035" width="174" height="145"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Comic Sans MS&quot;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>A debate followed as to whether the wall on the top of the balcony was in fact a ceiling thus
reinforcing Keith Phillips�s argument that the room did exist. Keith Jackson investigated and it was concluded that it was a figment of his imagination. (We were already aware of
his imaginary friends). We troughed and aled for two hours and went onto the next venue.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Comic Sans MS&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Comic Sans MS&quot;">�Uncle Toms Chop House� was an interesting choice being a refurbished public
convenience complete with its original Minton tiled walls. We were treated to the delights of waitress service by a gorgeous little Spanish tart with a lovely arse.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>John Commins was in for a further treat as he went to the basement bog.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He was just letting it
all hang out when bursting out of trap one came a blond haired lady.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She apologised but said that she hadn�t caught sight of
anything.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Don�t let it play on your mind John, they say the best things come in small packages.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Conversation about the future Oktober fest was high on the agenda and discussions of future outings ranged from France, Italy, Barcelona, Singapore, Bancock, South Africa to
Australia.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Whatever happened to Llandudno?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Then behold what was I seeing, the yupmeister
had sneaked in a glass of John Smiths Extra Smooth.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Had he finally seen the light?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We have
the photo to prove it if Michael ever learns how to send it from his mobile phone to a computer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Students eh!<span
style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>It was nearing six and time to leave for the main event.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Comic Sans MS&quot;">This was a classy little establishment, the �Shimla Pink� with proper tables and
walls that changed colour.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We were quickly shown to a table out of the way at the back whilst the pretty people were displayed in the
window seats.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The red wine and ale flowed with Keith Jackson receiving a larger than the average Budweisser, Dave Stubbs was
disappointed at the size of his.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The curries</span> <span style="font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Comic Sans MS&quot;">arrived followed by more ale and red wine.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There was a beautiful long blond haired
waitress serving another table, which caught Dave Stubbs�s attention so much, that she twice bolted for cover into the boiler room to avoid his lecherous gaze.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Keith Phillips was equally shunned as he tried to impress our waitress with his banter.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Dave
Stubbs made an equal arse of himself by ridiculing a chap who happened to be on his own, ably abetted by Richie who said that if I were him I�d order two meals and take one home
in a doggy bag when I left.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>After all you don�t want to look like Billy no mates. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>He was
then joined by a very pretty young lady who was all over him all night.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Throughout the curry something else started to change colour as
well as the walls.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It was Dave Carlidges white shirt, which gradually was becoming a speckled shade of yellow.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Michael was cringing throughout the meal regretting taking us to one of his regular establishments.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It
was now around eight and time to make a move but the yupmeister was proving reluctant to leave, as he appeared to be struggling to finish his red wine.<span
style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Was the writing starting to appear on the wall or was it those bloody coloured lights.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Comic Sans MS&quot;">We ventured onward towards the Station making our final watering hole yet another
Wetherspoons about the size as the one in Stafford.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>It was my round and offered Yup the choice of beers to which he replied J20 orange and passion fruit.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The pub fell
in silence as his reputation has preceded him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He was gone, he was beaten.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It must have
been the John Smiths Extra Smooth he sneaked in before the Curry.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Our mentor and leader has fallen claiming that it was the first time
in 30 years that he hasn�t finished off a curry night with a pint.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If he�d tried the cream flow before it may have been a different
story.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Comic Sans MS&quot;">We headed for the station followed by the J20 Kid who was haunched over with a rather
shameful and sad expression.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Were they cow eyes or was it the effects of the John Smiths Extra Smooth.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>We arrived at platform 5 and the gleaming vestal heading for Euston was awaiting.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>We bolted into the first carriage only to find that the next one was full of tarts.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Still we stood our ground anyway
or sat.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The J20 kid then started a bout of hiccups, which was only to subside as we were nearing home.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>On the journey we were continually teased by two 15 year old bare bellied tarts who showed the top of their knickers above their low cut jeans.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Sorry can�t type any slower. They were last seen leaving the station at Macclesfield closely followed by Mr �I�ve still got it�
Jackson.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Comic Sans MS&quot;">We finally arrived back all the better for the experience. Everything had gone like
clockwork in fact it couldn�t have gone any smoother.</span></p>

style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Transport from Stoke to be arranged by mini bus or taxis dependant on numbers.<span style="mso-spacerun:
