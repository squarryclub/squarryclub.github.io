<p><b>A Most Memorable Trip (especially for Mid-week Tone)</b></p>
<p>Richee, Craigee and Sean unfortunately dropped out of this one. Craigee had 
to attend a funeral in London, Richee has been transferred to the United Arab 
Emirates for a few months, and Sean was flogging Molly again in Australia,,, as 
he so often does.</p>

though:</p>

<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">It was our first 
trip to Liverpool’s Beer Festival and to get there we had to go through the 
process of applying for the tickets in pairs and wait for the ridiculous lottery 
procedure to be completed to see if we would actually receive any tickets. 
Amazingly, we were all successful.</p>

<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">On the way to 
Stoke Station it was impossible to pass the best butty shop in Stoke without 
dropping in. Even Silver Bear dropped in with the same thought in mind.</p></td>
