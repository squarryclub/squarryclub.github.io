<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>The evening began with a 5
O’clock minibus pick up for squarrites; - Yupmeister, Pedro, Grandpop Bill,
Craigee, Bolt, JayCee, Mr Toohigh and Dasher from that Potteries place. While
this was happening Jacko and Nige were heading for the No38 bus from Congleton;
2 Pie Hard Dave was driving from Alsager and Keithee’s up for it was walking
from home. Reg Rob and Mrs Reg Rob would be joining us later and Huge Mungeous
had to cry off as his daughter was not well. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>The minibus arrived about
5:50 and the occupants greeted by Keithee’s up for it. A quick discussion was
made with the option to wait for Jacko and Nige or to go straight to the pub. 3
seconds later upon arriving at the Lower Chequer drinks were ordered. A fine
selection of beers were on offer, from the very friendly Landlord, and met with
everyone’s approval. Jacko and Nige soon arrived followed by 2 Pie Hard Dave
who had been touring Sandbach for hours. Pies were ordered by the ravenous;
some shared with friends some with the dog. After a couple of pints and a wee
it was time to move on. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>A walk past the Saxon
Crosses and over the Scotch Common, brought us to the next venue; The Millitary
Arms (Keithee’s up for its local) where Reg Rob and Mrs Reg Rob were waiting.
Drinks were ordered from the fine selection including Cumberland, Timothy
Taylor and Speckled Hen.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>Another short stroll was
then made to the Aldi vineyard where wine and beer was purchased by the group
to consume with the curry. The curry house, The Eastern Spices, was just across
the road. It was small in size but has a good reputation of providing a fine
range of tasty meals. As usual the service was good; meals and drinks were good
and the very reasonable bill was paid.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>A good time was had by all.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:
Arial'>Keithee’s up for it</span></p>
