<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">Friday 31<sup>st</sup> 
March 06</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">A long time in 
coming, but D-Day had finally arrived.&nbsp; A potential army of 20 were up for this 
one with 2 weeks to go.&nbsp; As the day neared the deserters dropped like flies and 
went awol leaving definates Yup, Pedro, Jaycee, Keithee I’m up for it, Mid-week 
Tone, Jacko and Triglett.&nbsp; No firm response was received from the uncontrolled 
builders although whispers confirmed that they would catch up with us in Derby.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">At Stoke station 
Jaycee was spotted wandering about on the platform and was pulled back from the 
brink of getting lost again as has been known on several previous occasions on 
station platforms.&nbsp; Triglett, who was going to meet us at Blythe Bridge threw us 
all out of sync by turning up with a retired and satisfied grin on his face.&nbsp; 
The 13.30 train from Stoke station was bang on time with plenty of empty seats.&nbsp; 
A search through all the carriages confirmed Jacko had missed the train; but we 
later found out that he’d had a bout of bird flu or something similar, but it 
didn’t appear fatal.&nbsp; The closest we were to come to ‘smooth’ today, was going 
to be the train journey. &nbsp;The Virgins appear to have finally got it just right.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;Pedro came clean that he was indeed wealthy, despite the fact he never buys a 
round, and had selfishly bought himself 500 packs of ’12 days’ ale from Hook 
Norton where he’d dragged his wife Joan off to a few days earlier.&nbsp; Jaycee was 
previously unsure whether he’d make today cus of his prior appointment with the 
queen.&nbsp; Asked how the queen was, Jaycee confirmed that Carol was doing ok.&nbsp; 
Pedro, too mean to put a quid credit on his phone, successfully got sympathy 
from Keithee whilst sporting his new hanky-free phone, and borrowed a real phone 
to report home and check on the health of his goldfish.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">Out of the station 
and directly across the road the first pub, the Victorian Midland Hotel could be 
seen.&nbsp; But this wasn’t on the itinery researched and proposed by Camra expert 
Mid-week Tone.&nbsp; Instead we headed right and within a couple of shakes found 
ourselves entering the Brunswick inn, the oldest purpose-built railway inn 
allegedly.&nbsp; Wow, what a find, 18 or so hand-pulled ales and its own brewery.&nbsp; 
Spoilt for choice, Keithee opted for a pint of Pedi !!??.&nbsp; For the rest of us, 
the ‘house grog’ went down very well but the next pint of ‘Station Approach’ was 
top banana as they say!&nbsp; Jaycee, back on the ale after a lay-off, dropped down 
to a half, unusually !!&nbsp; We all agreed with Triglett that you have to make the 
best of your first 10 years retirement, but there was just one minor hurdle for 
most of us.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">The uncontrolled 
builders were not to be seen; perhaps they’d catch up with us at the next pub.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">Starving hungry, we 
reluctantly agreed to leave dining until we got to the second pub which had a 
reputation of serving pork and stuffing.&nbsp; Keithee had only had a spoonful of 
honey for breakfast (and just 15 rounds of toast!), and Pedro had been fighting 
with a kipper.&nbsp; A quick visit to the toilets which was mysteriously positioned 
very close to the brewing vessels as it happened, and we were back on the road 
to the second pub, the Old Silk Mill.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">Devoid of chevrons, 
Pedro was quick to point out the give way markings as we trundled across town to 
the Old Silk Mill.&nbsp; He loves his job !!</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">Unfortunately, the 
much anticipated&nbsp; hand-pulls weren’t on show at the Mill.&nbsp; The pub had changed 
hands just a few weeks previous, but despite our disappointment, most of us 
ordered very quaffable pints of London pride.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">We wanted stuffing 
of course and the young wench agreed. &nbsp;Her baps were offered up which were very 
tasty and came complete with chips, but there was no stuffing available.&nbsp; 
Triglett turned down her baps with Keithee explaining to her that he wasn’t 
allowed solids just yet.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">A discussion about 
hairy armpits emanated from the food order…. Keitheee had requested stilton 
instead of brie with his steak baguette, cus he doesn’t like the French……… hence 
hairy armpits.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">The uncontrolled 
builders were not to be seen; perhaps they’d catch up with us at the next pub.
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">Keithee rang around 
the office to get a contact phone number and surprisingly managed to get their 
extension numbers in the office which he eventually realised were of no use.&nbsp; In 
one last desperate attempt he managed to find one of their mobile numbers but 
only tuned in to the sounds of a rorcus background sound of another pub.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">There were a couple 
of light rain showers as we finished, so we delayed leaving for a couple of 
minutes so that Keithee wouldn’t get his hair wet.&nbsp; Setting off we passed the 
gable end mural which we all failed to spot !!.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">On our travels we 
passed (without stopping!) the Dolphin and the Standing Order, (a Wetherspoons 
pub previously an old Nat West bank) which we would encounter hopefully on our 
next visit.&nbsp; Turning right we entered the Bishop Blaise, the third pub.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">No Oakhams was 
available as we’d expected; only Landlord. Beggars can’t be choosers. &nbsp;Beers in, 
we made our way to the cool courtyard at the rear.&nbsp; At this point we all agreed 
that Jaycee was the only one amongst us with a memory that lasts longer than 2 
minutes.&nbsp; We recounted the pubs we’d passed including ‘Jorrocks’ which only he 
could remember.&nbsp; At least that’s what we thought he said.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">Group photos were 
taken as we relaxed and prayed for more strike days so that we could enjoy 
further away days like today.&nbsp; As one photo was taken, a swift movement from 
Jaycee helped to prove his pint had been fully drank!!&nbsp; The truths in the 
picture !!&nbsp; or is it??</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">The uncontrolled 
builders were not to be seen; perhaps they’d catch up with us at the next pub.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">Moving on we bumped 
into quarrelsome Ade who had made his own way to Derby in search of the team via 
Nottingham, Manchester and London.&nbsp; Passing a church the verger obviously knew 
we were Stoke fans as his bells chimed out ‘we hate Nottingham Forest, we hate 
……..’ ; unless he’d been to Wetherspoons of course.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">Our final pub was 
another Wetherspoons convert, the Babington Arms, where lo and behold, the 3 
remaining builders, Rob, Keith and Tony could be found out of control and much 
the worse for wear, after consuming nearly every one of the endless number of 
ales that were continuously being chalked up on a blackboard.&nbsp; Having got lost 
en-route to Derby, with a faulty sat-nav team, they’d decided to set off in 
reverse in the hope of bumping into us at some point; but having found Mecca, 
and not wishing to get lost again, they decided to stay put.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">After sampling the 
cherry flavoured ale, amongst others at £1.35 a pint, we staggered off in search 
of the Shalimar, leading the ‘sat-navs’ just in case.&nbsp; The Masala Art looked a 
possible venue for next time and the realisation to Trig that he’d been here 
before finally hit him.&nbsp; See what I mean about memory !</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">The attention and 
hospitality at the Shalimar was second to none; especially after Keithee 
explained we’d be putting a review on the website!&nbsp; Imran, our friendly waiter, 
attended to our every need and didn’t laugh too loud when a couple of steaks 
were ordered by the ‘sat-navs’.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">The journey back on 
the train was swift and comfortable, even for Keithee who continued on to 
Crewe.&nbsp; Uncontrollable Tone was driving back from Derby; and surely with the aid 
of a rejuvenated ‘sat-nav’ team of Rob and Keith they wouldn’t get lost again?? 
Surely not !!</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">Derby</span><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">, 
with a host of undiscovered pubs, including the Alexandra Hotel, the Olde 
Dolphine Inn, the Standing Order and the Flower Pot. will definitely be included 
on our list of future destinations; and who knows, the ‘sat-navs’ might not get 
lost next time.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">Cheers</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">Yupmeister</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">Enjoy yer baltis.</span></p>
